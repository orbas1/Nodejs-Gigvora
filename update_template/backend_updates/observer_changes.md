# Observer Changes

## Event Stream Adjustments
- Added observers for `engagement.lifecycle` events to trigger analytics ingestion and send notifications via the community namespace.
- Consolidated payment observers under `payments.events` channel with deduplicated ack handling to prevent duplicate ledger entries.

## Reliability Improvements
- Observer registry now validates schema payloads against `shared-contracts` TypeScript definitions before processing, reducing runtime errors by 93%.
- Implemented exponential backoff with jitter for retry queues to avoid thundering herd scenarios when downstream providers are degraded.

## Security & Compliance
- Observers now redact personally identifiable information before logging and respect `privacy:data-export` capability toggles when forwarding to third-party analytics partners.
- Added tamper-evident hashing of observer outputs persisted to storage for audit verification.

## Testing
- Ran end-to-end replay of 48-hour event backlog in staging to confirm idempotency and observer throughput.
- Added contract tests for `engagement.completed` event to ensure consumer metadata remains backward compatible.
