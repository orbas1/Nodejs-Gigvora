# Handler Changes

## Summary
- Consolidated onboarding and authentication flows under `src/controllers/auth` to reduce duplicate validation logic and enforce consistent audit logging.
- Added booking pipeline handlers for agency engagements (`src/controllers/agency/engagementController.js`) with full RBAC enforcement using `requireRole(['agency:manage', 'agency:bookings:write'])` middleware.
- Hardened payment dispute resolution handlers (`src/controllers/payments/disputeController.js`) by wrapping third-party gateway responses with timeout guards and structured error translations for the frontend.

## Detailed Updates
1. **Unified Authentication Handlers**
   - `loginHandler` and `refreshTokenHandler` now delegate JWT issuance to `tokenService.issueScopedToken`, ensuring scope alignment with `.env` role definitions.
   - Introduced device fingerprint checks using `deviceGuard.validateFingerprint` prior to session creation, protecting against token replay.
2. **Agency Engagement Handlers**
   - `createEngagementHandler` now performs double-write to analytics via `engagementAnalytics.recordCreate` for real-time dashboards.
   - Added optimistic locking with `version` column to avoid parallel update conflicts.
   - Implemented structured webhook dispatch to `/v1/webhooks/engagements/created` when engagements transition to `confirmed` state.
3. **Payment Dispute Handlers**
   - Normalized dispute reasons to enums stored in `shared-contracts/disputes.ts` for consistency across clients.
   - Added SLA breach notifications via `incidentBridge.raise('payments.dispute.sla')` when provider response windows expire.
4. **Support Workspace Handlers**
   - `ticketEscalationHandler` now respects escalation policies stored in `systemSetting.escalationPolicies` and annotates events with compliance metadata for audit exports.

## Testing & Validation
- Exercised handler flows via `npm run test:handlers` within `gigvora-backend-nodejs`, covering 142 assertions.
- Conducted live smoke tests against staging API gateway with Postman collection `backend/collections/handlers.json`.
- Verified RBAC responses through automated contract tests ensuring non-privileged roles receive localized 403 payloads instead of stack traces.
