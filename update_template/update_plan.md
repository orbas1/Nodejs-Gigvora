- Frontend updates to project workspace modules (dashboard, task board, budget, notification center).
- Backend API enhancements: workspace snapshots, escrow automation, analytics insights, RBAC enforcement.
- Mobile parity features mirroring core workspace flows (deliverables, meetings, verification).
- UI/UX refresh incorporating Aurora design tokens and accessibility improvements.
- Observability instrumentation for workspace interactions and SLA metrics.

### Excluded
- Provider mobile app (retired).
- Marketplace discovery features (deferred to 2024.08).
- Contract generation automation (tracked separately in LEG-2024).

## 3. Workstreams & Leads
| Workstream | Lead | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Frontend Web | Priya Nair | Implement workspace revamp, ensure responsive design, integrate feature flags. |
| Backend Services | Aaron Brooks | Extend workspace APIs, enforce RBAC & CORS policies, deliver analytics endpoints. |
| Mobile (Flutter) | Saanvi Rao | Align Flutter implementation with web flows and new tokens, ensure offline support. |
| QA & Automation | Fatima Al-Hassan | Expand regression suites, run automated scripts, coordinate performance testing. |
| DevOps | Olivia Bennett | Manage pipelines, infrastructure scaling, deployment orchestration. |
| Compliance & Security | Daniel Cho | Run penetration testing, validate data handling, oversee RBAC/CORS audits. |

## 4. Timeline & Milestones
Refer to `update_milestone_list.md` for the detailed timeline. Key phases:
1. **Design & Planning (May 1 – May 15)**
2. **Implementation (May 16 – June 11)**
3. **Integrated QA (June 12 – June 18)**
4. **Launch Preparation (June 19 – June 24)**
5. **Production Deployment (June 25)**
6. **Post-Launch Monitoring (June 25 – June 27)**

## 5. Dependencies
- Completion of analytics backend upgrade (`analytics-service` v3.4) by 2024-05-28.
- Availability of Chatwoot 2.4 for support integration (ETA 2024-06-05).
- AWS quota increase for WebSocket connections (submitted 2024-05-18, approved 2024-05-22).
- Legal approval of updated escrow terms (received 2024-06-10).

## 6. Implementation Strategy
- Adopt feature flags for workspace automation toggles and Risk Pulse widget to support phased rollout.
- Maintain release branch `release/2024.06` and require two approvals with green CI before merge.
- Use blue/green deployment for backend services with automated smoke testing.
- For frontend, deploy to staging CDN and run Lighthouse + Playwright smoke suite prior to production push.
- Mobile app update distributed via phased rollout (10% cohorts, then 50%, then 100%).

## 7. Testing Strategy
- Unit & integration coverage for backend (Jest) and frontend (Vitest + Testing Library).
- End-to-end regression using Playwright (web) and Detox (mobile) executed nightly.
- Performance benchmarks: workspace load <2.5s (p75), task update round trip <600ms.
- Security testing: OWASP ZAP automated scan, manual penetration testing on RBAC boundaries.
- CORS verification script executed per environment (see `update_tests/test_scripts/backend_test_script.md`).

## 8. Rollout Plan
1. **Pre-Launch**: Finalize release notes, confirm support rota, warm caches.
2. **Deployment Window**: 2024-06-25 03:00 UTC (low traffic). Backend deployed first, followed by frontend, then mobile feature flag activation.
3. **Validation**: Execute smoke tests (`update_tests/build_test_results.md` & `front_end_test_results.md`), monitor logs, verify analytics events.
4. **Post-Launch**: Keep feature flags in monitoring mode for 48 hours, enable automation toggles after validation, send customer communication.

## 9. Rollback Strategy
- Backend: maintain previous container images and database snapshot; rollback via blue/green switch within 10 minutes.
- Frontend: revert CDN pointer to last known good build, purge caches.
- Mobile: disable new features via remote config; if critical, trigger expedited hotfix release.
- Document all rollback actions in `end_of_update_report.md` if executed.

## 10. Communication Plan
- Daily stand-ups across disciplines during QA phase (June 12–18).
- Release readiness review 2024-06-24 with leadership.
- Customer update via email and in-app banner scheduled for 2024-06-25 post-launch.
- Support enablement session with playbooks and FAQ on 2024-06-23.

## 11. Risk Management
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Real-time channel saturation | Medium | High | Scale Socket.IO cluster, add monitoring for connection counts, auto-throttle high-volume rooms. |
| RBAC misconfiguration | Low | High | Automated RBAC regression suite, manual QA for role switching, logging review. |
| Escrow data migration | Low | High | Run migration in dry-run mode, maintain rollback script, backup before execution. |
| Performance regression on older devices | Medium | Medium | Use Chrome/Android emulators for p95, optimize bundling, lazy load heavy components. |

## 12. Acceptance Criteria
- All progress metrics in `update_progress_tracker.md` at or above 95% before go-live.
- No critical (P0/P1) bugs open at go/no-go checkpoint.
- Security sign-off documented with evidence of RBAC and CORS verification.
- Analytics dashboards reflecting new events with <2% error rate.

## 13. Post-Release Activities
- Monitor key metrics for 72 hours (workspace usage, dispute resolution time, crash rates).
- Conduct retro on 2024-06-27 capturing wins and improvement areas.
- Archive Aurora artifacts and update knowledge base with new documentation.
