# Frontend Updates — Admin Dashboard

## Summary
The admin dashboard receives a security-first refresh to centralise RBAC governance, compliance observability, and incident readiness. The layout now prioritises actionable insights over static charts, with contextual drill-downs for every widget.

## Key Enhancements
1. **Role Control Center Module**
   - Dynamic policy visualiser showing inheritance, conflicting grants, and environment overrides.
   - Inline remediation wizard with guardrails (dual approval prompts, rollback preview).
   - Exportable audit trail with signed hash for external compliance systems.
2. **Compliance Pulse Widgets**
   - SOC2 & GDPR readiness heatmap backed by real-time compliance checklist ingestion.
   - SLA breach ticker integrated with incident response playbooks.
3. **Operational Alerts Stream**
   - Unified feed aggregating rate limit anomalies, CORS violations, and authentication failures.
   - Snooze and assignment controls tied into PagerDuty + Slack connectors.
4. **Performance & UX Improvements**
   - All charts migrated to canvas rendering for 60fps interactions on mid-tier laptops.
   - Keyboard navigation map published; meets WCAG 2.2 AA focus indication requirements.
   - Light/dark themes harmonised with design token v3.2.

## Security & RBAC Considerations
- Every privileged action now checks for the `admin:roles.manage` scope and environment tag, preventing accidental production edits from staging accounts.
- CORS status widget pulls from the configuration service to highlight mismatched origins before rollout.
- Sensitive analytics tiles masked by default; require on-demand unlock with biometric/WebAuthn challenge.

## Telemetry & QA
- Added OpenTelemetry spans for policy diff generation, widget hydration, and export operations.
- Playwright regression suite covers navigation, search, and audit export flows across Chrome, Firefox, and WebKit.
- Lighthouse performance score improved from 78 → 92 by deferring non-critical scripts and adopting HTTP/3 image delivery.
