# Web Application Styling Updates â€” Aurora Release

## Token & Theme Changes
- Updated to Aurora color tokens with emphasis on contrast and color-blind safe palettes.
- Introduced gradient header background with subtle animation triggered on hover for interactive cards.
- Typography harmonized with Inter font family, establishing consistent heading/subheading scale.

## Layout Adjustments
| Area | Update | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Workspace Dashboard | Added responsive grid with minmax columns to maintain balance between analytics and tasks on wide screens. | Ensures readability and prevents whitespace on ultrawide monitors. |
| Navigation Sidebar | Increased width to 272px, introduced icon + label pairings, and improved active state indicator. | Better discoverability and scannability of key navigation items. |
| Panels & Cards | Added 16px rounding with subtle shadow (`0 8px 24px rgba(15, 23, 42, 0.08)`) and border token `#E2E8F0`. | Provides depth while retaining clarity for dense data. |
| Tables | Adopted zebra striping in focus mode, refined header typography, and introduced sticky action column. | Enhances data readability and improves mass-action workflows. |

## Interaction Enhancements
- Hover states now include background tint and icon animation to indicate interactivity.
- Focus outlines standardized to 2px highlight with 4px offset using `#6366F1` for accessibility.
- Loading placeholders use shimmering skeletons with accessible ARIA labels.

## Dark Mode Harmonization
- Colors recalibrated for dark theme: surfaces `#111827`, cards `#1F2937`, text `#F9FAFB`.
- Charts adopt high-contrast palettes with teal/orange pairings, maintaining readability of stacked data.
- Updated code block styling for developer-focused documentation sections.

## Performance Considerations
- All new background images converted to SVG or CSS gradients to reduce bundle size.
- CSS variables exported through design token pipeline enabling runtime theme switching.
- Verified Tailwind configuration includes new tokens and purges unused styles.

## QA & Documentation
- Updated Storybook stories for affected components with snapshots for light/dark modes.
- Added Chromatic baselines to catch regressions before release.
- Documented styling guidelines in `docs/aurora-style-guide.md` for onboarding new contributors.
