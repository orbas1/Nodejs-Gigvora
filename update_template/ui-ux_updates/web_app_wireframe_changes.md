# Web App Wireframe Updates — Aurora Release

## Overview
Web application wireframes have been restructured to emphasize actionable workspace data and ensure parity with the refreshed mobile experience. All changes support stronger RBAC cues, rapid access to support, and compliance-friendly escrow workflows.

## Updated Modules
1. **Workspace Overview Dashboard (WEB-WF-01)**
   - Consolidated analytics, task burn-down, and deliverable timelines into a modular grid with drag-and-drop panels.
   - Added "Risk Pulse" widget summarizing overdue tasks, unapproved invoices, and dispute counts.
   - Embedded live activity ticker with hover states exposing context and quick actions.

2. **Task Board Tab (WEB-WF-02)**
   - Introduced column-level health indicators and SLA badges for cards.
   - Added bulk actions for Admin and Manager roles with confirmation modals for destructive operations.
   - Provided inline filters for role, due date, and priority.

3. **Budget Management Tab (WEB-WF-03)**
   - Replaced static tables with interactive charts (stacked bar for spend vs. budget, line for forecast).
   - Added anomaly alerts triggered by backend analytics.
   - Created "Download Audit Trail" CTA for finance teams (Admin-only).

4. **Escrow Automation Panel (WEB-WF-04)**
   - Streamlined workflow to allow toggling automation rules with version history sidebar.
   - Added compliance checklist for each automation rule.

   - Added "SLA countdown" status for time-sensitive notifications.

## Navigation Enhancements
- Updated global navigation to surface "Workspace" ahead of "Agency" for workspace-first workflows.
- Added quick search overlay (Cmd/Ctrl + K) to jump between workspaces and tasks.
- Ensured breadcrumb component reflects new architecture (Workspace › Tab › Panel).

## Accessibility
- Verified keyboard navigation order across new modules; tab focus matches visual order.
- Added skip links for screen readers to jump to primary workspace content.
- All new charts include accessible text summaries and data download options.

## Collaboration Notes
- Wireframes include states for shared cursor presence to support synchronous editing.
- Comments thread anchored to right-hand inspector for consistent design/developer communication.
- All annotations reference engineering tickets and highlight security considerations (CORS, RBAC boundaries).
