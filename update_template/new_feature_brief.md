# New Feature Brief — Gigvora November 2024 Feature Pack

## Executive Summary
The November 2024 feature pack strengthens Gigvora's marketplace trust fabric while accelerating productivity for every persona. By combining an admin-centric Role Control Center, provider credentialing upgrades, serviceman mission tooling, and a trust-forward user profile, we close critical gaps identified by enterprise clients and the customer advisory board.

## Problem Statement
- Administrators lack a single dashboard to monitor RBAC drift and compliance posture, leading to slow incident response.
- Providers struggle to communicate credibility due to fragmented credential submission and outdated profile storytelling.
- Field servicemen need reliable, offline-friendly mission tooling with proactive SLA alerts.
- End users want transparent, personalised signals to build confidence before initiating engagements.

## Proposed Solution
1. **Role Control Center** consolidates policy management, audit visibility, and compliance status with robust guardrails.
2. **Provider Credibility Suite** delivers a guided onboarding experience, automated document checks, and portfolio storytelling.
3. **Serviceman Mission Control** equips field teams with offline checklists, SLA countdowns, and escalations.
4. **Trust-Focused User Profile** showcases activity, verification, and recommended next steps to deepen engagement.

## Business Impact
- Expected 25% lift in verified provider conversions within 60 days of launch.
- Forecasted 30% reduction in SLA breaches thanks to proactive serviceman tooling.
- Anticipated 45% faster policy remediation for admins, decreasing compliance incident MTTR.
- Improved net promoter score by +6 points through enhanced transparency and personalisation.

## Success Metrics
- RBAC audit completeness = 100% within 5 minutes of change.
- Provider onboarding completion rate ≥ 90% without human intervention.

- User profile completion rate ≥ 85% and daily active recommendations click-through ≥ 18%.

## Constraints & Assumptions
