# Frontend Test Results — Aurora Release

- **Environment**: Node.js 18.19.0, npm 10.5.x, Vitest 1.6.1, jsdom 24
- **Command**: `npm test -- --run`
- **Execution Time**: Aborted after 12 minutes due to excessive React `act(...)` warnings

## Summary
| Suite | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| WorkspaceManagers tests | ⚠️ Blocked | Components trigger state updates outside `act(...)`, causing repeated warnings and slow execution. 【036100†L1-L64】【d4e2f3†L1-L27】 |
| Admin Speed Networking components | ⚠️ Not completed | Execution halted mid-suite because overall run aborted. 【d4e2f3†L23-L27】 |
| Website Preferences forms | ⚠️ Not completed | `BasicsHarness` emits `act(...)` warnings; run terminated before suite conclusion. 【cc7820†L1-L20】 |
| Hooks package tests | ✅ Passing | `group100` hooks suite completes successfully. 【036100†L65-L70】 |

## Issues Identified
- Multiple workspace manager components update state during asynchronous callbacks without being wrapped in React Testing Library's `act(...)`. This results in verbose warnings and potential flaky assertions. 【8a141f†L1-L40】
- Speed networking drawer tests appear to stall due to asynchronous modal behavior requiring `await screen.findBy...` adjustments. 【d4e2f3†L23-L27】
- Website preferences form harness requires conversion to user-event flows with `await act(async () => ...)` wrappers. 【cc7820†L1-L20】

## Next Actions
1. Audit Workspace manager tests to wrap asynchronous updates in `act(...)` and replace manual promises with RTL utilities.
2. Refine SpeedNetworking drawer tests to await overlay transitions and close modals deterministically.
3. Re-run Vitest suite capturing clean results and store in `artifacts/aurora/tests/frontend-vitest.log`.

## Risk Assessment
- Severity: **Medium** (test coverage gaps but application functionality unaffected). Release should be blocked until warnings resolved to ensure deterministic CI runs.

## Evidence
- Raw log: `vitest.log` (attached to release ticket `FE-811`).
