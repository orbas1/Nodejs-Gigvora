# Backend Test Results — Aurora Release

- **Environment**: Node.js 18.19.0, npm 10.5.x, local SQLite test database
- **Command**: `npm test` (runs Jest with `--runInBand`)
- **Execution Time**: ~9 minutes (interrupted after repeated failures)

## Summary
| Suite | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| controllers/creationStudioController.test.js | ❌ Failing | `res.end` spy never called when archiving item; investigate controller response handling. |
| controllers/explorerController.test.js | ❌ Failing | `storeMock.createRecord` not invoked as expected; payload normalization logic requires review. |
| lifecycle/workerManager.test.js | ✅ Passing | Validated worker start/stop flows and telemetry logging (with intentional network failure simulation). |
| lifecycle/server.start-stop.test.js | ✅ Passing | Start/stop lifecycle assertions succeeding. |

## Failure Details
- `creationStudioController` archive test expects the controller to end the response. Current implementation likely returns status 204 but omits `res.end()`. Update controller and adjust integration coverage. 【73d9de†L1-L22】
- `explorerController` create test throws `TypeError` because the store mock was never called. Validate request validation branch and ensure the service invocation path triggers the store. 【ee889c†L1-L15】

## Next Actions
1. Patch controllers to satisfy the expected contract (send 204 + `end`, ensure store invocation with normalized payload).
2. Update integration tests to cover the corrected behavior and prevent regression.
3. Re-run Jest suite and capture clean run output for release evidence.

## Risk Assessment
- Severity: **High** (API regression risk for content management workflows).
- Mitigation: Block release until failing cases resolved or re-scoped with product approval.

## Evidence Artifacts
- Raw test logs stored in CI artifact `aurora-backend-jest-2024-06-18.log`.
- Issue tracking: `API-912` (creation studio) and `API-913` (explorer controller).
