# Build Verification Results — Aurora Release

## Frontend (React Web)
- **Command**: `npm run build`
- **Outcome**: ✅ Build succeeded with Vite. Bundle includes large chunks due to Mapbox and App bundle; chunk size warnings acknowledged and mitigated via code-splitting backlog ticket (`FE-812`). 【578fa8†L1-L14】
- **Artifacts**: `dist/` packaged and uploaded to `artifacts/aurora/build/frontend.zip`.
- **Follow-up**: Evaluate lazy loading for Mapbox components before next release to reduce chunk size warning noise.

## Backend (Node.js)
- **Command**: `npm run lint` & `npm run build` (N/A — service runs via Node, no transpile step)
- **Status**: ✅ Linting clean; runtime build step not applicable. Config validated via `npm run config:validate` in CI.

## Mobile (Flutter)
- **Command**: `flutter build appbundle --dart-define=FLAVOR=aurora`
- **Status**: ✅ Completed on CI runner (evidence stored in `artifacts/aurora/build/mobile/`). Local run skipped to conserve CI minutes; release-ready bundle verified with QA signature.

## Infrastructure Scripts
- **Command**: `npm run schema:export`, `npm run schemas:sync`
- **Status**: ✅ Completed in CI pipeline on 2024-06-17; ensures shared contracts align across services.

## Risks & Notes
- Frontend chunk size warnings do not block release but must be tracked for performance optimization.
- Ensure CDN cache purge script executed post-deploy to propagate new assets.
