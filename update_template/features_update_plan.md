# Features Update Plan — Gigvora November 2024 Feature Pack

## Release Objectives
1. Deliver a security-first admin control experience with verifiable RBAC governance.
2. Empower providers and servicemen with guided workflows that shorten time-to-value.
3. Elevate user trust perception through transparent profile storytelling and actionable insights.
4. Launch with zero critical regressions by enforcing exhaustive automation, manual QA, and observability coverage.

## Timeline & Milestones
| Phase | Dates | Goals | Deliverables |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Discovery & Architecture | 28 Oct – 1 Nov | Finalise solution architecture, confirm data contracts, baseline risk register. | Updated sequence diagrams, ERD amendments, approved API contract v2.4. |

| Build Sprint 2 | 18 Nov – 29 Nov | Launch Provider Credibility Suite and Serviceman Mission Control components. | Credential upload flow, offline-ready serviceman console, contract tests, localisation strings. |
| Hardening & UAT | 2 Dec – 11 Dec | Execute performance/security validations, polish trust-focused user profile, complete regression suite. | Load test reports, OWASP ASVS checklist, WCAG audit, signed release candidate. |
| Launch & Hypercare | 12 Dec – 20 Dec | Deploy progressively, monitor SLIs, close feedback loop with GTM teams. | Feature flag rollout plan, hypercare playbook, executive dashboard with live KPIs. |

## Cross-Team Responsibilities
- **Product & Design:** Validate copy, flows, and accessibility. Deliver final Figma prototypes with redlines by 1 Nov.
- **Backend Engineering:** Extend RBAC microservice, credential verification pipeline, and job status APIs. Maintain 95%+ unit test coverage.
- **Frontend Engineering:** Ship responsive dashboards across web and mobile breakpoints using component library v3.2. Integrate telemetry instrumentation.
- **Security & Compliance:** Review RBAC policy templates, penetration test credential workflows, verify CORS allowlist matches deployment matrix.
- **Data & Analytics:** Define trust score formulas, ensure events land in Snowflake within 5 minutes, update Looker dashboards.
- **Support & Operations:** Prepare updated SOPs, hypercare scripts, and knowledge base articles prior to launch announcement.

## Risk & Mitigation
- **RBAC Regression Risk:** Mitigated via automated policy snapshot diffing, blue/green rollout, and circuit breaker toggles.
- **Credential Verification Latency:** Cache warmup jobs pre-deployment, fallback to manual review queue with SLA under 4 hours.
- **Offline Serviceman Usage:** Bundle critical assets for offline use, implement sync conflicts resolver, run field pilot tests.
- **CORS Misconfiguration:** Ship automated integration tests that validate preflight responses per environment; keep allowlists in config service.

## Launch Criteria
- All new endpoints have contract tests, rate limiting, and observability hooks (tracing + SLIs) enabled.
- RBAC mutations require dual-approval workflow in production environments.
- P0/P1 bugs closed, P2 issues have signed risk acceptance with remediation dates.
- Customer advisory board completes acceptance walkthrough with satisfaction score ≥ 4.5/5.
- Analytics dashboards confirm baseline metrics (role remediation time, credential completion rate, SLA adherence) within 48 hours of launch.
