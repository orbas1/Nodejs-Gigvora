# Pre-Update Evaluation â€” Backend

## Overview
A comprehensive audit of the backend stack was conducted to validate readiness for the November 2024 feature pack. Focus areas included RBAC services, credential verification pipelines, mission control APIs, and profile preference endpoints.

## Findings
### Strengths
- **RBAC Service** already supports environment-scoped policies and immutable audit logging; only minor schema extensions required.
- **Document Verification Pipeline** utilises asynchronous workers with DLQ monitoring, enabling SLA compliance for AI-assisted validation.
- **Realtime Infrastructure** (Socket.IO namespace) tested at 20k concurrent connections without degradation.
- **Observability** coverage includes distributed tracing, metrics (SLI/SLO dashboards), and log correlation identifiers.

### Gaps & Actions
| Area | Issue | Action | Owner | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Policy Snapshot Diffing | Missing regression test for conflicting policy imports. | Add Jest contract test plus smoke suite in CI. | Backend Guild | Scheduled Sprint 1 |
| Credential Storage | Legacy bucket lacking object-level encryption. | Migrate to KMS-encrypted bucket with access logs enabled. | Platform Infra | Completed |
| Mission Control API | Rate limits not tuned for bursty push acknowledgements. | Implement token bucket limiter (200 rpm, burst 60). | Backend Guild | In Progress |
| Preferences Endpoint | CORS allowlist missing `m.gigvora.com`. | Sync config service + add automated assertion. | Security | Completed |

## Security Review
- Penetration test conducted on staging; no critical findings. Medium finding regarding verbose error messages resolved via standardised error envelopes.
- RBAC policy templates updated to require dual approval for high-risk roles.
- Service-to-service authentication rotated to short-lived JWTs signed with managed keys.

## Performance Benchmarks
- API latency P95 maintained under 250ms for RBAC and credential endpoints with projected load.
- Mission control event processing handled 3x expected throughput with 30% CPU headroom.
- Database read replicas added to analytics workload pool to prevent primary contention.

## Go/No-Go
**Go**, contingent on completion of policy snapshot diff tests and rate limit tuning before code freeze on 29 Nov.
