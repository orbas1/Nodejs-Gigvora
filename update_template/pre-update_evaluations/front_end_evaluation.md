# Pre-Update Evaluation — Frontend

## Audit Scope
Evaluated readiness of the web frontends (admin, provider, serviceman, user portals) for the November 2024 feature pack. Focus on performance, accessibility, localisation, and security hardening.

## Findings
### Strengths
- Component library v3.2 integrated with minimal breaking changes; tokens ensure consistent theming.
- Lazy-loading strategies reduce Largest Contentful Paint to <2.2s P75 across roles.
- i18n pipeline covers EN/ES; fallback copy verified with product.
- Storybook documentation updated for new components with usage guidelines and accessibility notes.

### Issues & Remediation
| Area | Finding | Mitigation | Owner | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Keyboard Navigation | Two provider widgets lacked focus outline. | Applied focus token + manual regression. | Frontend Guild | Completed |
| Offline Checklist | Service worker cache invalidation risk for SOP updates. | Added versioned asset manifest + background sync revalidation. | Web Platform | Completed |
| WebAuthn Prompts | Modal didn't trap focus on Safari. | Patched focus trap utility; added cross-browser tests. | Frontend Guild | Completed |
| CORS Error Handling | Generic error toast lacked context. | Replaced with structured error component referencing support docs. | Security | Completed |

## Performance Benchmarks
- Lighthouse scores: Admin 92, Provider 90, Serviceman 94, User 93.
- Bundle sizes reduced 10–15% via route-level code splitting and image optimisation.
- Web vitals tracking integrated with Segment + Datadog dashboards.

## Accessibility
- WCAG 2.2 AA compliance validated using Axe, manual keyboard/reader testing, and colour contrast audits.
- High contrast and reduced motion modes fully supported, persisted via preference centre.

## Security
- CSP updated to allow WebAuthn endpoints and block inline scripts.
- CORS middleware validated in staging for all SPA origins; automated integration tests guard regressions.
- Session timeout warnings standardised; idle logout flows tested across roles.

## Recommendation
Frontend is **Go** for implementation, contingent on continuous monitoring of Lighthouse and web vitals during rollout.
