# Pre-Update Evaluation â€” User App

## Scope
Validated readiness of the end-user facing web and mobile (PWA) experiences for the trust-focused profile refresh and recommendation engine integration.

## User Journeys Reviewed
- Profile completion flow (identity verification, preferences, notification setup).
- Viewing and acting on personalised recommendations.
- Exporting activity timeline and managing privacy settings.
- Accessing support and trust resources from within the profile.

## Findings
### Highlights
- PWA manifest updated to include mission-critical assets for offline access to preference centre.
- Identity verification flow integrates with new document validation pipeline; user sees clear status updates.
- Recommendation carousel surfaces contextual CTAs with deep links into providers, mentorship, and security settings.
- Accessibility preferences immediately reflected in UI without full page reload.

### Issues & Actions
| Issue | Severity | Action | Owner | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Recommendation analytics event missing locale context. | Medium | Append locale metadata to tracking payload; validate in Segment. | Growth Engineering | Completed |
| Privacy toggle copy ambiguous for shared profiles. | Low | Update copy via CMS to clarify visibility impact. | Product Content | Completed |
| Activity export CSV lacked timezone metadata. | Low | Append timezone column + header note. | Frontend Guild | Completed |

## Performance & Reliability
- P95 profile load time: 1.1s on fibre, 2.0s on 3G Fast (meets SLA <2.5s).
- Offline mode caches last 30 days of activity; gracefully notifies when data >30 days requires online refresh.
- Error handling surfaces friendly messaging with ability to contact support.

## Security & Compliance
- All preference mutations require re-authentication when toggling security-sensitive settings.
- CORS allowlist validated for mobile web origin `m.gigvora.com` following configuration update.
- Privacy exports emit audit events stored in compliance data lake for 7 years.

## Recommendation
User app experience is **Go**. Monitor recommendation engagement and privacy toggles post-launch to ensure adoption goals met.
