## Main Category 17. Enterprise 360 Cohesion & Futureproofing

### Subcategory 17.A. Unified Design System & Theming Fabric
1. **Appraisal.** Gigvora's visual foundation spans shared CSS tokens, Tailwind layers, and Flutter theme bundles that ensure every surface—from the React shell to the mobile client—expresses a consistent executive-grade aesthetic.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/index.css†L1-L112】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/main.dart†L1-L272】 The appraisal verifies parity between desktop gradients, typography, and elevation with Material 3 theming on mobile, assessing how onboarding, dashboards, mentor cards, and finance flows inherit the same tonal balance. Reviews incorporate Figma alignment, asset export workflows, and accessibility heuristics to guarantee LinkedIn-class polish across light, dark, and high-contrast variants while avoiding aesthetic drift between squads.
   - *Design Source of Truth.* Catalogue token ownership, component specs, and release notes across design, code, and documentation repositories to prevent fragmentation.
   - *Cross-platform Fidelity.* Compare React, Flutter, and email rendering outputs side-by-side to validate spacing, iconography, and motion guidelines remain cohesive.
   - *Brand Governance.* Ensure palette decisions ladder up to Gigvora's narrative—credible, future-forward, mentor-first—by running periodic stakeholder critiques.
   - *DesignOps Workflow.* Evaluate how tokens propagate via CI/CD, Storybook snapshots, and Flutter package updates to maintain a predictable release cadence.
   - *Motion Grammar.* Audit micro-interactions, hover reveals, skeleton states, and focus choreography to confirm they feel premium without sacrificing responsiveness.
   - *Theme Variants.* Review current and planned shell themes (midnight, aurora, executive) for clarity on when each persona experiences them and what context triggers theme swaps.
   - *A11y Comprehensiveness.* Confirm design docs capture contrast ratios, focus states, and screen reader ordering for every component variant.
   - *Globalisation Alignment.* Validate typography, character sets, and spacing work for multilingual copy without clipping or overflow.
2. **Functionality.** The design system wires tokens into React contexts, CSS utility classes, and Flutter providers, ensuring runtime theme swaps propagate without reloads while preserving skeleton fallbacks and analytics instrumentation.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/index.css†L1-L112】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/main.dart†L1-L272】 Functionality review tracks how shell overlays, status palettes, and theming loaders hydrate on boot, how user preference toggles (dark/high-contrast) reconcile with organisational defaults, and how mobile clients prefetch theme bundles with graceful degradation when assets fail. We map component dependency graphs, verifying that nav bars, cards, modals, and timeline elements consume tokens via composition rather than duplicating inline styles.
   - *Runtime Switching.* Stress-test real-time shell theme changes triggered by persona shifts or campaign banners to ensure smooth transitions and analytics capture.
   - *Fallback Pathways.* Document skeleton, shimmer, and neutral states when theme bundles fail to load, ensuring no blank screens occur.
   - *Preference Persistence.* Confirm theme preferences persist securely across sessions and devices while respecting enterprise policy overrides.
   - *Email & PDF Consistency.* Trace how brand tokens flow into transactional email templates and exported PDFs, updating generation pipelines as needed.
   - *Token Distribution.* Analyse build steps distributing CSS variables to Tailwind layers and Flutter design packages, preventing stale caches.
   - *Design QA Automation.* Integrate visual regression snapshots in CI to catch token regressions or layout shifts early.
   - *Component Contracts.* Document prop-level agreements for design system primitives so teams integrate new tokens without breaking older experiences.
   - *Error Telemetry.* Instrument theme loading failures with actionable logs and alerts to drive quick remediation.
3. **Logic Usefulness.** The theming logic orchestrates persona-specific shells, nuance for trust-and-safety surfaces, and context-driven overlays that reinforce Gigvora's professional tone while minimising cognitive load.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/index.css†L78-L112】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/main.dart†L58-L272】 Reviews ensure conditional theme swaps (e.g., security pages adopting midnight palette) align with compliance expectations, that mentor journeys highlight warmth without sacrificing neutrality, and that fallback logic defends against inconsistent states. We evaluate decision trees governing gradient intensity, focus treatment, and CTA prominence to keep signals clear for founders, mentors, and recruiters.
   - *Persona Rules.* Map persona-to-theme heuristics and confirm they derive from validated research rather than arbitrary defaults.
   - *State Awareness.* Ensure logic gracefully handles partial data (e.g., missing brand assets) without visual glitches.
   - *Feature Flag Coordination.* Audit theme experiments and rollouts to avoid conflicting overrides between squads.
   - *Telemetry Feedback.* Correlate engagement metrics with theme variants to validate improvements or identify regressions.
