   - *Ops Telemetry.* Worker manager samples feed runtime observability to expose queue depth, stuck lock detection, and failure tallies for each orchestrator loop.
   - *Realtime Telemetry.* `getRuntimeOperationalSnapshot` emits a `realtime` payload sourced from the socket connection registry, surfacing namespace occupancy, connection ratios, and anomaly signals when limits near saturation.
   - *Worker Health Streams.* Operational snapshots fold in `collectWorkerTelemetry` output to expose queue depth, stuck jobs, and failure counts across orchestrators.
