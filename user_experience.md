2.B. Onboarding Journeys
1. **Appraisal.** OnboardingWizard welcomes members with a premium hero shell, progress telemetry, and persona storytelling that mirrors leading social platforms.
   - *Hero narrative.* Gradient headline, trust copy, and progress bar showcase readiness to operate like LinkedIn or Instagram from the first screen.
   - *Persona storytelling.* PersonaSelection cards surface benefits, metrics, and signature moments so newcomers immediately feel represented.
2. **Functionality.** The wizard ships an end-to-end flow covering persona selection, profile calibration, collaborator invites, preference tuning, and launch review without gaps.
   - *Multi-step orchestration.* Persona, profile, team, preferences, and summary steps guard validation and carry analytics events across the journey.
   - *Actionable review.* Summary checklist, milestones, and persona modules translate setup inputs into launch guidance.
   - *Full-stack persistence.* `/onboarding/personas` hydrates the persona rail and `/onboarding/journeys` stores persona, profile, invite, and preference payloads through onboarding models, migrations, and seeds while the wizard drives requests via `listOnboardingPersonas` and `createOnboardingJourney`.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/routes/onboardingRoutes.js†L1-L11】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/onboardingService.js†L1-L185】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/onboardingModels.js†L1-L86】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/database/migrations/20250401100000-create-onboarding-tables.cjs†L1-L123】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/database/seeders/20250401101500-onboarding-personas-seed.cjs†L1-L74】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/services/onboarding.js†L1-L20】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/auth/onboarding/OnboardingWizard.jsx†L35-L337】
