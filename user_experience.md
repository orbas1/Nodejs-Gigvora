1.B. Landing & Hero Surfaces
1. **Appraisal.** Public marketing hero greets visitors with gradient shells, persona chips, and immersive media that mirror LinkedIn/Instagram polish while spelling out Gigvora’s multi-persona promise from the first screen.
   - *First impression.* Layered halos, capsule CTAs, and trust copy telegraph a premium, enterprise-ready network within seconds of arrival.
   - *Persona empathy.* Capsule chips and value cards call out founders, agencies, mentors, recruiters, and talent cohorts to ensure every visitor sees themselves reflected instantly.
2. **Functionality.** Hero orchestrates analytics instrumentation, CTA handling, and value-pillars so marketing funnels tie brand storytelling to measurable activation steps.
   - *Analytics & CTAs.* View + CTA events fire with hero IDs for telemetry, while actions trigger callbacks, router links, or external URLs without duplicating click logic.
   - *Ticker & media.* Reduced-motion aware ticker, skeleton loaders, and progressive image/video panels keep the experience resilient across network states.
   - *Full-stack hydration.* Site settings sanitise persona chips and value pillars, the 20250418 migration seeds defaults, and the marketing home hook hydrates them into the hero so growth teams can edit without redeploying code.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/siteManagementService.js†L42-L152】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/database/migrations/20250418091500-site-hero-pillars.cjs†L5-L320】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/hooks/useHomeExperience.js†L5-L166】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/pages/home/HomeHeroSection.jsx†L30-L158】
   - *Test coverage.* Jest migrations and Vitest hero specs lock the new hydration and analytics behaviour for back-end payloads and front-end CTAs.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/tests/migrations/group118Migrations.test.js†L286-L362】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/marketing/__tests__/PublicHero.test.jsx†L12-L122】
3. **Styling & Motion.** Gradient backgrounds, glassmorphism cards, and responsive grids reproduce the premium aesthetic across desktop and mobile while respecting reduced-motion preferences.
   - *Gradient storytelling.* Radial overlays and blur halos hug hero media and cards to match premium marketing moodboards.
   - *Responsive layout.* Two-column hero, ticker rail, and card grid collapse elegantly into stacked mobile shells with consistent rhythm.
4. **Value Pillars.** Dedicated pillar cards pair icons, metrics, highlights, and analytics hooks so the hero doubles as a conversion-ready proof stack.
   - *Metric storytelling.* Each pillar couples copy with measurable stats (cycle-time, uptime, network scale) to reinforce trust.
   - *Action instrumentation.* Optional CTA per pillar routes through analytics so growth teams can iterate on which proof points convert.
   - *Backend alignment.* ValuePillars now resolves backend icon keys, analytics metadata, and fallbacks so proof points render consistently across shared hero surfaces.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/marketing/ValuePillars.jsx†L1-L237】

2.A. Authentication Surfaces
2.A.1. SignInForm.jsx
1. **Appraisal.** The sign-in shell now greets returning members with provenance tags and trusted-device callouts so premium accounts feel instantly recognised before typing a password.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/access/SignInForm.jsx†L40-L118】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/access/SignInForm.jsx†L280-L317】
2. **Functionality.** Credential submits, two-factor verification, resend throttles, and LinkedIn redirects run against the live auth endpoints, giving the UI the same guarantees as the production API and helper utilities.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/access/SignInForm.jsx†L188-L365】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/utils/authHelpers.js†L139-L214】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/authService.js†L635-L733】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/routes/authRoutes.js†L36-L54】
3. **Logic Usefulness.** Prefill metadata, remembered-device persistence, and login audits combine to deliver explainable flows for support and security teams, mirroring the backend audit trail and domain normalisation.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/access/SignInForm.jsx†L90-L247】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/authService.js†L655-L724】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/domains/auth/authDomainService.js†L320-L348】
4. **Database & Seeding Alignment.** Two-factor defaults, social IDs, memberships, and consent states ride on the same Sequelize model, migrations, and demo seeds that power production so contract drift is impossible.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/index.js†L684-L732】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/database/migrations/20250218090000-auth-password-reset-and-user-enhancements.cjs†L21-L76】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/database/migrations/20250329120000-auth-signup-persona-alignment.cjs†L17-L20】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/database/seeders/20240501010000-demo-data.cjs†L7-L95】

6. **Resilience & Accessibility.** Query-string hydration degrades gracefully, remembered-device cues only fire when storage succeeds, and redirect helpers fall back with empathetic messaging when providers are unavailable—all while maintaining keyboard and screen-reader affordances.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/access/SignInForm.jsx†L58-L214】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/utils/authHelpers.js†L139-L214】

2.A.2. SignUpForm.jsx
1. **Appraisal.** Invite-aware notices, persona badges, and a live setup tracker wrap registration in LinkedIn-grade polish while reinforcing the value of every persona journey.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/access/SignUpForm.jsx†L75-L132】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/access/SignUpForm.jsx†L358-L446】
2. **Functionality.** Deep-link hydration, password strength enforcement, persona selection, and marketing preferences hit the production registration endpoint so the same payload powers feature flags and welcome journeys.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/access/SignUpForm.jsx†L102-L446】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/utils/authHelpers.js†L139-L214】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/authService.js†L602-L632】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/routes/authRoutes.js†L25-L33】
3. **Logic Usefulness.** The multi-section progress engine mirrors backend validation, normalising memberships, consent, and signup channel metadata so teams can trust readiness metrics before submission.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/access/SignUpForm.jsx†L231-L333】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/domains/auth/authDomainService.js†L320-L348】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/validation/schemas/authSchemas.js†L90-L158】
4. **Database & Seeding Alignment.** Preferred roles, memberships, marketing consent, and social IDs map directly onto Sequelize columns and seeded demo accounts, eliminating contract drift between UI and persistence.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/index.js†L684-L720】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/database/migrations/20250329120000-auth-signup-persona-alignment.cjs†L17-L20】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/database/seeders/20240501010000-demo-data.cjs†L7-L95】
5. **Styling & Motion.** Rounded progress rails, persona chips, and balanced typography keep the onboarding rhythm consistent with enterprise design tokens while highlighting successes with accessible colour ramps.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/access/SignUpForm.jsx†L358-L518】
6. **Compliance & Resilience.** Age validation, consent toggles, and invite-prefilled marketing choices degrade gracefully when inputs are missing, ensuring every submission satisfies policy requirements before hitting the API.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/access/SignUpForm.jsx†L200-L520】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/utils/validation.js†L17-L74】

2.A.3. PasswordReset.jsx
1. **Appraisal.** ResetPasswordPage wraps the reset journey in a gradient hero and concierge-style guidance while PasswordReset mirrors that polish with masked-email reassurance and inline policy tips so members feel looked after as they secure their account.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/pages/ResetPasswordPage.jsx†L10-L41】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/access/PasswordReset.jsx†L239-L287】
2. **Functionality.** Verification kicks off immediately, streaming expiry telemetry, enforcing the 12-character mixed-case policy, and blocking submission until shared validations succeed, all backed by password-policy metadata from the API.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/access/PasswordReset.jsx†L200-L324】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/utils/validation.js†L17-L108】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/authService.js†L934-L975】
3. **Logic Usefulness.** Masked identities, countdowns, and completion copy pair with backend refresh-token revocation and the `password_reset_tokens` schema so security teams can audit every reset end-to-end.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/access/PasswordReset.jsx†L239-L355】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/authService.js†L955-L975】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/database/migrations/20250218090000-auth-password-reset-and-user-enhancements.cjs†L12-L36】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/index.js†L24-L43】
4. **Redundancies.** A single password-policy definition feeds frontend rule displays and backend enforcement, keeping guidance, analytics, and validation logic in sync across every authentication surface.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/utils/validation.js†L17-L108】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/authService.js†L40-L586】
5. **Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs.** Live countdowns, caps-lock alerts, policy summaries, and success messaging replace placeholder copy and dormant CTAs so every interaction ships production ready.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/access/PasswordReset.jsx†L258-L355】
6. **Styling and Colour review changes.** Rounded shells, accent meters, and neutral surfaces keep the reset form aligned with authentication tokens while preserving accessible focus states.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/access/PasswordReset.jsx†L258-L324】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/pages/ResetPasswordPage.jsx†L10-L41】

   - *Administrative framing.* Dashboard layout introduces dedicated breadcrumbs, operations section menus, and hero copy so change management content sits alongside other admin KPIs without feeling bolted on.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/pages/dashboards/admin/AdminReleaseEngineeringDashboard.jsx†L9-L205】
2. **Functionality.** Release dataset tracks highlights, approvals, communications, change volume, and risk registers per version so compliance, QA, and comms can inspect canonical metadata in one place.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/data/releaseEngineeringDataset.js†L137-L185】
   - *Normalisation.* Service layer sorts notes by recency, calculates highlight/approval counts, and exposes aggregated stats like latest version and average highlights for dashboards and tooling.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/releaseEngineeringService.js†L132-L149】
   - *API delivery.* Controller returns the composed suite on `/release-engineering/suite`, letting both web clients and CLI scripts consume live change-management data through the same authenticated endpoint.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/releaseEngineeringController.js†L1-L10】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/routes/releaseEngineeringRoutes.js†L1-L13】
3. **Logic Usefulness.** Digest builder converts release data into Markdown tables, approvals, and action lists so enablement teams export single-source notes without copying from spreadsheets, while UI cards cap highlight lists for scannability.【F:scripts/release-notes/buildReleaseDigest.mjs†L29-L143】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/ReleaseOperationsBoard.jsx†L100-L170】
   - *Error tolerance.* Frontend normalisers default null highlights, blockers, and stats to safe arrays/zeros so stale caches never break release storytelling even during API outages.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/services/releaseEngineering.js†L10-L45】
   - *Testing & fallback.* Dashboard seeds a rich fallback suite and caches previous payloads when fetches fail, ensuring exec reviews always show the last known release story with explicit messaging about stale data.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/pages/dashboards/admin/AdminReleaseEngineeringDashboard.jsx†L27-L180】
4. **Redundancies Removed.** Shared digest script publishes docs into the same update_docs tree the rest of the organisation uses, preventing parallel “release notes” exporters or ad-hoc wiki entries from diverging.【F:scripts/release-notes/buildReleaseDigest.mjs†L130-L149】【F:update_docs/release_notes/2025-10-27-2025-04-0-release-digest.md†L1-L47】
   - *Menu integration.* Admin menu sections and quick tool catalogs reference release operations once, ensuring future navigation updates automatically surface change management without extra configuration branches.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/pages/dashboards/admin/adminMenuConfig.js†L57-L105】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/pages/dashboards/admin/menuSections.js†L1-L146】
   - *Route registry.* Shared contract registry advertises the route for other clients (mobile, desktop shell) to prefetch release operations without hardcoding paths, keeping multi-platform navigation coherent.【F:shared-contracts/domain/platform/route-registry.js†L400-L452】
5. **Backlog & Roadmap.** Release entries capture change volume, toggle counts, and risk register IDs, signalling upcoming enablement work and mitigation tasks so product ops can stage messaging, support docs, and rollback plans.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/data/releaseEngineeringDataset.js†L158-L184】
   - *Action export.* Digest script aggregates blockers across pipelines and cohorts into an Action Items section so programme managers know exactly which mitigations to chase in retros or go/no-go meetings.【F:scripts/release-notes/buildReleaseDigest.mjs†L109-L125】【F:update_docs/release_notes/2025-10-27-2025-04-0-release-digest.md†L38-L43】
   - *Enablement analytics.* Board telemetry surfaces release approval deltas and logged entries count to highlight documentation completeness and QA/compliance coverage trends over time.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/ReleaseOperationsBoard.jsx†L172-L289】

16.C. Upgrade Rollout & Monitoring
1. **Appraisal.** Upgrade cohort cards bring the same glassmorphism, status badges, and guardrail readouts that our networking and onboarding surfaces use, making rollout governance feel equally premium and legible.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/ReleaseOperationsBoard.jsx†L123-L170】
   - *Storytelling.* Cohort sections emphasise stage labels, adoption, health, guardrails, and blockers, visually narrating rollout momentum and readiness for executives without diving into raw spreadsheets.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/ReleaseOperationsBoard.jsx†L134-L167】
   - *Hero context.* Dashboard subtitle and description anchor the page around build, change, and rollout monitoring so stakeholders know they are reviewing full lifecycle health in one place.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/pages/dashboards/admin/AdminReleaseEngineeringDashboard.jsx†L195-L205】
2. **Functionality.** Dataset tracks cohorts with feature flags, adoption, guardrails, telemetry, blockers, and next checkpoints so operations can stage pilot → staged rollout → GA decisions with clear data points.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/data/releaseEngineeringDataset.js†L186-L257】
   - *Ranking logic.* Service sorts cohorts by stage priority then adoption to bubble urgent pilots ahead of GA-ready cohorts, while stats summarise blocker lists and adoption averages for summary cards.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/releaseEngineeringService.js†L152-L170】
   - *Frontend hydration.* Board pipes cohorts into dedicated cards and summarises pipeline/rollout totals in hero stats so admins grasp both macro and micro rollout status in the first scroll.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/ReleaseOperationsBoard.jsx†L172-L303】
3. **Logic Usefulness.** Health summary merges pipeline blockers and cohort blockers, surfaces overall pipeline status, and exposes release currency timestamps to help programme leads assess readiness before go/no-go calls.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/releaseEngineeringService.js†L173-L192】
   - *Fallback state.* Dashboard seeds fallback cohort data so even first load (before API resolves) highlights adoption posture, guardrails, and blockers, ensuring operations never start with empty shells.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/pages/dashboards/admin/AdminReleaseEngineeringDashboard.jsx†L27-L153】
   - *Test enforcement.* Component test asserts cohort names render, guarding against regressions that might hide adoption or checkpoint data in future refactors.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/__tests__/ReleaseOperationsBoard.test.jsx†L4-L85】
4. **Redundancies Removed.** Board reuses formatting helpers for percent, duration, and dates, centralising conversions so upgrade analytics match pipeline stats formatting without duplicate utilities scattered across admin modules.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/ReleaseOperationsBoard.jsx†L12-L42】
   - *API contract.* Release engineering service normalisers guarantee blockers arrays and metrics always exist, so cohort and pipeline cards reuse the same mapping logic without defensive checks per component.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/services/releaseEngineering.js†L10-L45】
   - *Route governance.* Authenticated route ensures rollout telemetry sits behind the same admin RBAC as other governance dashboards, consolidating security posture for programme health tooling.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/routes/releaseEngineeringRoutes.js†L1-L13】
5. **Backlog & Roadmap.** Cohort notes and blockers highlight follow-up work—like translation QA and analytics verification—so programme managers can capture Jira stories straight from the dataset without mining separate docs.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/data/releaseEngineeringDataset.js†L200-L233】
   - *Status export.* Generated digest tables list stages, adoption, guardrails, and checkpoints, giving ops and support teams printable snapshots for regional stand-ups or investor briefings.【F:scripts/release-notes/buildReleaseDigest.mjs†L40-L55】【F:update_docs/release_notes/2025-10-27-2025-04-0-release-digest.md†L31-L37】
   - *Refresh cadence.* Dashboard exposes refresh and loading states, plus manual refresh control, so programme leads understand when data was last generated and can trigger updates before major reviews.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/ReleaseOperationsBoard.jsx†L209-L257】
15.C. Integration & Stub Environments
1. **Appraisal.** Calendar stub now mirrors production-grade integrations: it seeds workspaces and events from shared JSON datasets, enforces production event-type gates, persists mutations when configured, and exposes health metadata so stakeholders trust local environments like hosted pilots.【F:calendar_stub/server.mjs†L653-L864】【F:calendar_stub/README.md†L1-L35】
2. **Functionality.** CRUD routes, scenario toggles, latency controls, strict validation, and persistence hooks ship end to end; tests exercise listing, creation, updates, deletions, error cases, and disk snapshots so teams rely on the stub for live flows without patching code mid-demo.【F:calendar_stub/server.mjs†L720-L1053】【F:calendar_stub/server.test.mjs†L20-L421】
3. **Logic Usefulness.** Seed loading normalises datasets, applies enterprise window defaults, sanitises metadata, and exports summary analytics that align with the MySQL seeder because both reuse the same fixture normalisers and the shared calendar event-type contract, ensuring integrations ingest authoritative intelligence across environments.【F:calendar_stub/server.mjs†L330-L863】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/database/seeders/20241031090500-company-calendar-demo.cjs†L1-L255】【F:shared-contracts/domain/platform/calendar/constants.js†L1-L46】
4. **Redundancies.** Dataset parsing, workspace lookup, role normalisation, request gating, and metadata shaping all flow through consolidated helpers (`extractWorkspaces`, `resolveSeedDataset`, `ensureEventShape`, `authorizeRequest`) so future integrations reuse canonical behaviours instead of re-implementing calendar math.【F:calendar_stub/server.mjs†L148-L623】【F:calendar_stub/fixtures.mjs†L1-L220】
5. **Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs.** Default fixtures, metadata sanitisation, and write-through persistence replace lorem events or inert endpoints; QA now manipulates real gig, mentorship, and volunteering payloads while the stub writes a traceable dataset to disk.【F:calendar_stub/data/company-calendar.json†L1-L94】【F:calendar_stub/server.mjs†L720-L1013】
6. **Duplicate Functions.** Runtime resets, workspace refreshes, persistence hooks, and exported sanitisation helpers expose shared methods for tests, Storybook sandboxes, and backend harnesses, keeping integration utilities DRY across repos.【F:calendar_stub/server.mjs†L980-L1053】【F:calendar_stub/server.test.mjs†L229-L421】
7. **Improvements need to make.** Roadmap notes keep recurring events, external sync, and ICS export on the backlog while today’s build focuses on deterministic CRUD contracts, telemetry-ready metadata, and production-grade validation.【F:calendar_stub/README.md†L73-L109】
8. **Styling improvements.** Serialized events now bundle duration minutes, recalculated `upcoming`/`in_progress`/`completed` statuses, and grouped summaries so UI shells inherit polished metric ribbons and capsule chips straight from the stub payloads.【F:calendar_stub/server.mjs†L402-L520】
9. **Effeciency analysis and improvement.** Configurable latency providers, scenario short-circuits, numeric ID normalisation, and shared metadata cleaners guard performance profiling and correctness, letting teams rehearse degraded networks without sacrificing deterministic behaviour.【F:calendar_stub/server.mjs†L180-L748】【F:calendar_stub/server.test.mjs†L91-L208】
10. **Strengths to Keep.** Scenario maps, workspace catalogues, analytics summaries, and persisted datasets that teams rely on remain intact—now reinforced with role normalisation and dataset loading—preserving the loved “live-like sandbox” rhythm while gaining resilience.【F:calendar_stub/server.mjs†L172-L863】
11. **Weaknesses to remove.** Unsupported event types, numeric/string ID mismatches, and dataset shape gaps are gone thanks to canonical validation, tolerant comparisons, and combined file loaders backed by the shared contract; mixed fixture inputs no longer break PATCH/DELETE flows or workspace hydration.【F:calendar_stub/server.mjs†L752-L1013】【F:calendar_stub/server.test.mjs†L248-L370】【F:shared-contracts/domain/platform/calendar/constants.js†L1-L46】
12. **Styling and Colour review changes.** Summary builders and metadata normalisers emit status, event-type groupings, and permission badges that slot directly into premium UI tokens, keeping palette and typography guidance consistent across clients.【F:calendar_stub/server.mjs†L402-L520】【F:calendar_stub/README.md†L32-L109】
13. **Css, orientation, placement and arrangement changes.** CORS enforcement, allowed-method headers, workspace slug/header fallbacks, and role normalisation keep cross-device shells aligned regardless of orientation or deployment footprint, mirroring production gateway rules.【F:calendar_stub/server.mjs†L46-L215】【F:calendar_stub/server.mjs†L720-L824】
14. **Text analysis, text placement, text length, text redundancy and quality of text analysis.** README guidance spells out usage, headers, role defaults, validation rules, and backlog boundaries with editorial clarity so cross-functional stakeholders can activate the stub without guesswork.【F:calendar_stub/README.md†L1-L120】
15. **Text Spacing.** Default window ranges (30-day backfill, 45-day lookahead) and filter echoes keep time horizons consistent, giving designers predictable “spacing” for scheduling density across dashboards.【F:calendar_stub/server.mjs†L312-L520】【F:calendar_stub/server.mjs†L809-L853】
16. **Shaping.** Grouped events, available workspace metadata, and schema versioning sculpt the payload the way enterprise shells expect—complete with capsule-ready segments and admin permissions inlined for fast shaping.【F:calendar_stub/server.mjs†L720-L863】
17. **Shadow, hover, glow and effects.** Scenario hooks and latency simulators let QA rehearse hover/loader feedback, rate-limit glows, and error panels without editing code, matching the interaction polish outlined in design reviews.【F:calendar_stub/server.mjs†L172-L263】【F:calendar_stub/server.test.mjs†L118-L208】
18. **Thumbnails.** Participant, attachment, and metadata sanitisation provides ready-made “thumbnail” context—owner names, notes, related entities—so list and card components surface rich snapshots instantly.【F:calendar_stub/fixtures.mjs†L33-L152】【F:calendar_stub/server.mjs†L470-L520】
19. **Images and media & Images and media previews.** Attachment sanitisation and metadata copying ensure previews, decks, and async brief links persist through CRUD cycles, keeping media storytelling intact during demos.【F:calendar_stub/fixtures.mjs†L53-L152】【F:calendar_stub/server.mjs†L897-L959】
20. **Button styling.** Allowed method lists, role checks, and persistence gating enforce the same action affordances as production—manage roles can create/update/delete, viewers stay read-only—so button states across apps stay authoritative.【F:calendar_stub/server.mjs†L12-L214】【F:calendar_stub/server.mjs†L897-L1013】
21. **Interactiveness.** Tests drive keyboard-friendly API flows—creating, patching, deleting, fetching—and verify analytics hooks like persistence snapshots and validation errors, proving the stub responds instantly to integrator actions.【F:calendar_stub/server.test.mjs†L20-L421】
22. **Missing Components.** Persisted datasets now include workspace listings, event summaries, and metadata so doc sites, SDKs, and admin consoles no longer fabricate those panels while running locally.【F:calendar_stub/server.mjs†L720-L1053】【F:calendar_stub/README.md†L32-L109】
23. **Design Changes.** Seed resolution now returns combined workspaces/events, persistence writes schema-versioned JSON, reset hooks cascade through the same helpers, and role defaults align with production without breaking consumers.【F:calendar_stub/server.mjs†L248-L1053】
24. **Design Duplication.** Dataset loaders, workspace normalisers, metadata prep, and exported sanitisation helpers reuse shared utilities from fixtures so new repos (mobile, CLI) can import the same logic instead of cloning brittle helpers.【F:calendar_stub/fixtures.mjs†L1-L220】【F:calendar_stub/server.mjs†L148-L623】
25. **Design framework.** Environment variables, README tables, and persist defaults slot into the broader platform governance so DevOps, QA, and docs reference the same framework when spinning up stubs.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/.env.example†L44-L53】【F:calendar_stub/README.md†L12-L120】
26. **Change Checklist Tracker Extensive.** Node test suites verify CRUD, scenario, dataset, persistence, and validation-error paths; README updates document env vars and unsupported areas, giving QA and enablement teams the artefacts they need for sign-off.【F:calendar_stub/server.test.mjs†L20-L421】【F:calendar_stub/README.md†L12-L120】
27. **Full Upgrade Plan & Release Steps Extensive.** Persisted JSON outputs, shared seeders, and scenario toggles let teams promote changes from local to staging with traceable artefacts, gating rollout via feature flags and telemetry just like the production upgrade plan.【F:calendar_stub/server.mjs†L622-L1053】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/database/seeders/20241031090500-company-calendar-demo.cjs†L1-L255】
