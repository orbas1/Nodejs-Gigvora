2.B. Onboarding Journeys
1. **Appraisal.** OnboardingWizard welcomes members with a premium hero shell, progress telemetry, and persona storytelling that mirrors leading social platforms.
   - *Hero narrative.* Gradient headline, trust copy, and progress bar showcase readiness to operate like LinkedIn or Instagram from the first screen.
   - *Persona storytelling.* PersonaSelection cards surface benefits, metrics, and signature moments so newcomers immediately feel represented.
2. **Functionality.** The wizard ships an end-to-end flow covering persona selection, profile calibration, collaborator invites, preference tuning, and launch review without gaps.
