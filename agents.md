# Error Report

## Backend (gigvora-backend-nodejs)

### `npm run lint -- --quiet`
- ESLint still passes cleanly; running without `--quiet` continues to flag legacy `import/order` and `import/no-named-as-default(-member)` warnings across controllers, routes, models, and tests.

### `npm test`
- `npm test -- agencyDashboardService` remains green after normalising scheduled payout totals and limiting finance exports to the most recent available batch in `src/services/agencyDashboardService.js`.
- `npm test -- companyDashboardService.partnerships` continues to pass now that `tests/setupTestEnv.js` eagerly loads the full model registry before running the shared Sequelize bootstrap.
- SQLite continues to emit the unsupported `TEXT` warning whenever the suite syncs the in-memory schema.

## Frontend (gigvora-frontend-reactjs)

### `npm run lint`
- ✅ Passes after slimming the header to a logo-only navigation, replacing the hero/home partials with the new professional community landing experience, and pruning the legacy section components that previously triggered unused-module warnings.
- ✅ Revalidated after turning the hero background back to white and removing the stat cards so the landing screen matches the requested minimal presentation.
- ✅ Confirmed again after reshaping the floating messaging trigger into an authenticated-only circular button so the dock no longer appears for anonymous visitors.
- ✅ Rechecked after enlarging the header logo and removing the partner banner beneath the hero to keep the landing layout on spec.

### `npm start`
- ✅ Launches the Vite development server on port 4173 (`vite --host 0.0.0.0 --port 4173 --strictPort`) and now renders the refreshed landing page with working language selector, login/register buttons, and updated footer links for About and Blog.

### `npm run build`
- ✅ Succeeds with the rebuilt landing page and lean header after swapping unsupported hero icon imports for the shipped `SquaresPlusIcon` and cleaning unused home components.
- ✅ Rebuilt to confirm the stat-free hero renders as expected in production output.
- ✅ Reconfirmed following the header logo resize and removal of the hero-adjacent partner strip.

## Phone App (gigvora-flutter-phoneapp)

### `flutter analyze`
- Unable to execute because the Flutter SDK is not installed in this environment (`bash: command not found: flutter`).

# Proposed Tasks
1. Address backend test environment warnings by reviewing Sequelize model definitions for unsupported `TEXT` options in SQLite.
2. Triage the remaining backend lint warnings by standardising import order and default-vs-named exports across legacy modules.
3. Provide a reproducible Flutter toolchain (or add CI notes) so `flutter analyze` can eventually run in this workspace.
4. Add regression coverage around the React saved-search caching layer to lock in the new local-storage and refetch behaviours.
