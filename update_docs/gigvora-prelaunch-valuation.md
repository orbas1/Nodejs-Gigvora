# Gigvora Pre-Launch Valuation Narrative

## Executive Summary
Gigvora is positioned to become the unified operating system for independent talent, agencies, and enterprises orchestrating on-demand work. The product delivers a full-stack marketplace, compliance, and collaboration suite across web, mobile, and admin channels. Pre-launch valuation focuses on traction proxies (waitlist, pilot cohorts), defensibility (compliance automation, RBAC governance), and monetisation readiness.

## Market Opportunity
- **Total Addressable Market:** $240B global freelance economy with accelerated adoption in regulated industries (finance, healthcare, public sector) requiring compliant platforms.
- **Serviceable Obtainable Market (24-month horizon):** $1.8B across UK/EU/US scale-ups and mid-market firms seeking hybrid workforce orchestration tools.
- **Drivers:** Regulatory pressure (IR35, GDPR, DSA), remote work normalisation, and demand for integrated gig management tooling.

## Product & Differentiation
- Unified workspace covering talent discovery, project delivery, finance/escrow, communications, and analytics with enterprise-grade RBAC.
- Compliance automation (GDPR packs, policy management, audit trails) reduces overhead versus piecemeal solutions.
- Mobile parity ensures workforce adoption and retention, bridging the gap between field operations and HQ oversight.

## Traction Signals
- 4,800-member waitlist segmented into freelancers (55%), agencies (25%), enterprise buyers (20%).
- Three live pilot programmes with regulated partners validating onboarding, escrow, and dispute workflows.
- Strategic partnerships in negotiation with background screening providers and insurance carriers to deepen moats.

## Revenue Model
- **Subscription Tiers:** Workspace licenses billed per active seat with add-ons for compliance packs and analytics.
- **Transaction Fees:** Escrow releases, dispute mediation, and marketplace placements carry blended 6–10% fees.
- **Value-Added Services:** Premium integrations (Salesforce, HubSpot, Workday), custom analytics, and managed onboarding packages.

## Financial Forecast (Years 1–3)
| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ARR | £1.8M | £5.5M | £12.4M |
| Gross Margin | 68% | 73% | 78% |
| Net Revenue Retention | 105% | 118% | 125% |
| EBITDA | -£1.2M | £0.3M | £2.4M |

## Valuation Rationale
- Comparable SaaS marketplaces (Worksome, Toptal, Deel) trade at 8–12x forward ARR; applying a conservative 7x multiple to Year-2 ARR (£5.5M) yields a £38.5M valuation.
- Premium justified by regulated industry focus, compliance automation IP, and mobile/web parity shipping at launch.
- Downside protection through diversified revenue streams (subscriptions + transaction fees) and high switching costs tied to workflows and audit histories.

## Key Risks & Mitigations
- **Regulatory shifts:** Maintain close alignment with legal advisors; update compliance playbooks and data governance docs quarterly.
- **Marketplace liquidity:** Invest in targeted acquisition campaigns, incentives, and partner channel programmes to balance supply/demand.
- **Operational scale:** Expand support and success teams, automate onboarding using admin dashboards, and maintain robust observability.

## Next Steps
- Finalise pilot-to-paid conversions with launch partners.
- Secure strategic seed extension to fund go-to-market and compliance certifications.
- Publish updated investor memo with store launch metrics once mobile apps are live.
