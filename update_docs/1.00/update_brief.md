# Version 1.00 – Update Brief

## Executive Overview
Version 1.00 elevates Gigvora from a feature-rich beta to a fully orchestrated, FCA-compliant marketplace with omnichannel parity. Guided by the comprehensive roadmap in `Update Plan.md`, the milestone schedule, and progress tracker, this release unites Flutter, React, Node.js, and infrastructure teams to deliver blue-branded experiences, secure financial flows, and automation for discovery, projects, and monetisation. Empty pre-update issue/fix registers prompted an embedded discovery effort so defects and gaps are captured as part of Milestone 1.

## Strategic Goals
1. **Omnichannel Delivery:** Achieve full parity across web and Flutter apps, covering chat, live feed, explorer/search, projects, jobs, volunteers, and ads with blue theming.
2. **Trust & Compliance:** Launch FCA-aligned escrow, disputes, and ledger infrastructure with Cloudflare R2 media governance, ensuring auditable payments and dispute resolution.
3. **Intelligent Growth:** Provide LinkedIn-grade discovery, auto-assign, Experience Launchpad, and Volunteer matching to accelerate project/job fulfilment.
4. **User Archetypes & Employment:** Empower freelancers, agencies, companies, and volunteers through upgraded profiles, dashboards, ATS flows, and availability toggles.
5. **Monetisation & Brand:** Ship Gigvora Ads, homepage/website/mobile redesigns, and marketing enablement to drive revenue and adoption.

## Quality Assurance & Testing Strategy
- Security scans, linting, dependency checks embedded in CI for backend, frontend, Flutter, and provider apps.

- Integration testing coverage includes backend services, React frontend, Flutter user app, provider app dashboards, database migrations, API contracts, business logic state machines, and design accessibility audits.
- Regression rehearsals before Milestone 5 with failure triage, fix verification, and go/no-go gating.

## Documentation & Release Deliverables
