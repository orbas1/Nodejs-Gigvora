# Version 1.00 – Update Brief

## Executive Overview
Version 1.00 is the programme that elevates Gigvora from an MVP marketplace into a production-grade, mobile-first work platform. The release unifies the redesigned React web experience with a fully featured Flutter phone application, introduces compliance-ready escrow and dispute infrastructure, and builds monetisation levers such as Gigvora Ads. It also expands user archetypes with agency and company dashboards, deepens profiles, and layers automation for search, launchpad, and volunteer experiences. Delivery spans three programme increments (16 weeks total) with weekly checkpoints, staged feature flags, and FCA governance gates to guarantee a safe, high-impact launch.

## Strategic Goals
- **Frictionless collaboration** for freelancers, agencies, companies, and volunteers by delivering connected chat, project management, and live feed experiences across web and mobile.
- **Regulatory trust and financial safety** through FCA-compliant escrow, auditable dispute flows, and role-based access for agencies/companies.
- **Engagement and monetisation** by launching live feed, auto-assign, launchpad, volunteers hub, and Gigvora Ads with shared analytics instrumentation.
- **Mobile parity** so ≥95% of web capabilities are accessible with ≤1s navigation latency on mid-tier devices while maintaining brand-consistent blue theming.

Success metrics include 30% growth in user-to-user interactions, ≥90% profile completion, ≥60% launchpad placement within 14 days, and zero unresolved compliance gaps at external audit.

## Scope Overview
### In Scope
- Flutter mobile app covering onboarding, live feed, search, chat, project management, jobs, ads, and volunteer experiences.
- Blue design system roll-out across web and mobile with reusable design tokens, component libraries, and accessibility compliance.
- Backend rebuild for escrow, disputes, project management, Meilisearch-powered discovery, auto-assign, agency/company roles, ads suite, and Cloudflare R2 media delivery.
- Profile overhaul, launchpad automation, volunteer hub, employment/ATS expansion, and floating chat bubble with inbox enhancements.
- Quality governance including automated testing (unit, integration, end-to-end, performance, security), beta programmes, analytics and monitoring dashboards, and release certification gates.

### Out of Scope
- Provider-specific phone app assets (retired in 1.10 change log) and legacy feature sets not aligned with the new unified client vision.
- Non-UK compliance regimes outside the FCA scope addressed this cycle; future localisation is deferred to subsequent releases.
- Major pricing model changes beyond ads monetisation and escrow fee structures.

## Workstreams & Core Deliverables
### Design & Experience
- Conduct UX audits, produce blue brand tokens, refresh iconography, and create Figma component libraries for cross-platform reuse.
- Deliver responsive wireframes for homepage, feed, search, chat, project management, ads, launchpad, and volunteer journeys; run accessibility audits (WCAG 2.1 AA).

### Flutter Mobile Delivery
- Establish modular monorepo, implement shared networking, secure storage, analytics, and error logging services.
- Build feature modules (auth, feed, messaging, projects, jobs, ads, volunteer) with offline caching, push notifications, deep linking, and golden/UI tests.
- Integrate with backend REST/GraphQL endpoints and set up CI/CD (Codemagic/GitHub Actions) for automated builds and store readiness.

### Web Frontend
- Introduce blue design tokens, update navigation, hero sections, CTA flows, and live feed components.
- Implement floating chat bubble, volunteer/launchpad surfaces, job board dashboards, profile component architecture, and Gigvora Ads console with analytics charts.
- Harden routes with auth guards, loading/error states, accessibility improvements, and responsive layouts.

### Backend & Services
- Build FCA-compliant escrow ledger with double-entry accounting, payouts, and dispute hooks.
- Deliver multi-stage dispute management with timers, evidence storage on Cloudflare R2, mediator tooling, and audit logs.
- Expand project management schema (tasks, milestones, objectives, time logs, group chat) with WebSocket/SSE updates and notifications.
- Deploy Meilisearch pipelines, ranking rules, and APIs powering explorer/search, auto-assign, launchpad, and volunteer features.
- Implement agency/company archetypes with permissions, ATS pipeline, screening questions, interview scheduling, and HR analytics.
- Launch Gigvora Ads suite (campaign builder, targeting, budgeting, billing) plus analytics endpoints and dashboards.
- Integrate Cloudflare R2 for media, configure signed URLs, lifecycle policies, and monitoring for latency/error budgets.

### Data, Compliance & Legal
- Author migration scripts for profile enhancements, job imports, volunteer flags, and historical data backfill with GDPR-compliant retention policies.
- Execute FCA compliance review, KYC/KYB provider integration, dispute terms drafting, threat modelling, and penetration testing for payment flows.

### Quality Assurance & Release Management
- Build automated test suites (backend/frontend/unit, Flutter integration, Cypress/Appium E2E, performance, security).
- Stand up staging environment with production-like data, coordinate beta cohorts for mobile and live feed, and track defect burn-down.
- Configure feature flags, train support/success teams, update knowledge bases and onboarding materials, and orchestrate phased rollout (dogfood → beta → GA).

## Task & Squad Coordination
- **Design System Squad:** Token management, component specs, accessibility compliance, cross-platform asset delivery.
- **Mobile Squad:** Flutter modules, offline/cache strategy, notifications, app store readiness, beta feedback triage.
- **Web Squad:** Navigation overhaul, live feed UI, profile rebuild, volunteer/launchpad surfacing, ads dashboard.
- **Core Services Squad:** Escrow, disputes, project management, Meilisearch search/indexing, auto-assign engine, analytics.
- **User Archetypes Squad:** Agency/company roles, employment/ATS, launchpad, volunteer flows, profile expansion.
- **Compliance & Data Squad:** KYC/KYB alignment, legal documentation, migrations, GDPR/privacy controls, audit logging.
- **QA & Release Squad:** Test automation, performance/security suites, staging management, release certification, support enablement.

Each squad delivers weekly status updates feeding the update_progress_tracker, which will monitor planned vs actual completion, quality gates, and risk burndown.

## Quality & Risk Controls
Pre-update evaluations identified validation gaps, security risks, and missing integrations across backend, web, and mobile stacks. Version 1.00 addresses these by:
- Implementing request validation, pagination, structured error handling, and secure 2FA delivery in backend services.
- Adding responsive design, accessibility support, environment-based configuration, and guarded routes on the web front-end.
- Establishing Flutter state management, secure token storage, offline resilience, and crash reporting.

Key risks include FCA approval timing, data migration complexity, infrastructure provisioning, and change management for large UX shifts. Mitigations involve early compliance engagement, rehearsed migration playbooks, redundant infrastructure setups, feature flags, and comprehensive training/documentation.

## Progress Tracking & Reporting
- **Planning Baseline:** Update_plan.md and update_task_list.md store phase scopes, backlog, and acceptance criteria per squad. Any changes require CAB approval.
- **Milestone Tracking:** update_milestone_list.md captures the week 4/8/12/14/16 gates with entry/exit criteria; progress reports will be attached after each review.
- **Execution Metrics:** update_progress_tracker.md logs task burndown, defect density, compliance checklist status, and beta feedback, refreshed twice weekly.
- **Quality Gates:** No release candidate advances without green automated test suites, resolved critical defects, documented compliance sign-off, and updated support collateral.

## Launch Readiness Checklist
- Feature flags configured with rollback strategy for escrow, disputes, auto-assign, and ads.
- Production infrastructure scaled with monitoring dashboards (Datadog/New Relic) covering API latency, error rates, escrow transactions, and media delivery.
- Analytics events validated for live feed, chat, projects, jobs, ads, launchpad, and volunteer interactions to feed KPI dashboards.
- Support teams trained on new flows, with updated knowledge base articles, onboarding email campaigns, and in-app walkthroughs.
- Post-launch review scheduled to capture adoption, incident response, and backlog inputs for Version 1.10 and beyond.

## Conclusion
Version 1.00 is Gigvora’s largest release to date, delivering mobile parity, compliance, automation, and monetisation pillars demanded by the marketplace strategy. With disciplined execution across squads, rigorous quality controls, and proactive risk management, the update will position Gigvora as a trustworthy, full-lifecycle platform for talent, agencies, companies, and volunteers.
