# Web Application Design Overview & Brief – Version 1.00

## Executive Summary
- Reimagined Gigvora web application emphasising blue-forward gradient system, rounded geometry, and enterprise-grade storytelling.
- Provides consistent experience across marketing, discovery, dashboard, and collaboration surfaces.

## Objectives
1. Increase conversion from homepage by 18% via clearer CTAs and proof sections.
2. Improve discovery efficiency through debounced search, cached states, and multi-filter UI.
3. Enhance retention by modernising dashboard modules and profile presentation.

## Deliverables
- Component specs (`component_types.md`, `component_functions.md`).
- Styling definitions (`Stylings.md`, `colours.md`, `Fonts.md`, `Css.md`, `Scss.md`).
- Page blueprints (`Home Page` documents, `Dashboard`, `Profile`).
- Data, navigation, and asset registers (`Menus.md`, `Resources.md`, `Assets.md`).
- Logic flows and diagrams (`Logic_Flow_update.md`, `Logic_Flow_map.md`).

## Success Metrics
- Homepage bounce rate reduced by 10%.
- Explorer search to apply conversion increase by 12%.
- Dashboard task completion rate improved by 20%.
- Accessibility audits pass WCAG 2.1 AA.

## Stakeholders
- Product: Director of Product (owner), Product Designer (author of specs).
- Engineering: Frontend lead, Backend lead for API dependencies.
- Marketing: Brand manager for imagery approvals.

## Timeline
- Design sign-off: Week 1.
- Development sprint: Weeks 2–4.
- QA & Accessibility: Week 5.
- Launch: End of Week 5.

## Dependencies
- Updated asset pipeline (see `Assets.md`).
- API endpoints for metrics and search caching (see backend update docs).

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Asset Delivery Delay:** Mitigate via placeholder art from Storyset until final brand photography ready.
- **Performance Impact:** Monitor with Lighthouse; lazy load heavy modules.
- **Adoption:** Provide developer hand-off session and Storybook updates.
