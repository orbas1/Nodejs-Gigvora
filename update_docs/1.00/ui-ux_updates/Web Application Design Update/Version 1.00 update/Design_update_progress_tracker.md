# Web Application Design Update â€“ Progress Tracker

| Metric | Score (0-100%) | Evidence / Commentary |
|--------|----------------|-----------------------|
| Design Quality Grade | 65% | Homepage and navigation concepts validated with stakeholders; booking flow visuals incomplete. |
| Design Organisation Grade | 72% | IA mapping and template inventory organised in shared workspace; documentation still missing for CMS handoff. |
| Design Position Grade | 60% | Revised brand narrative drafted but requires alignment with marketing leadership. |
| Design Text Grade | 55% | Copy refresh underway; compliance text pending legal review. |
| Design Colour Grade | 70% | Web palette aligned with system tokens; contrast checks for hover states outstanding. |
| Design Render Grade | 58% | High-fidelity renders complete for hero and testimonials; configurator screens mid-fidelity. |
| Compliance Grade | 50% | Accessibility requirements documented, legal copy in review queue. |
| Security Grade | 48% | Security messaging identified; MFA UI patterns yet to be vetted. |
| Design Functionality Grade | 62% | Booking flow logic mapped but conditional edge cases (multi-day events) unresolved. |
| Design Images Grade | 52% | New imagery guidelines defined; asset sourcing not finalised. |
| Design Usability Grade | 59% | Internal testing shows improved navigation clarity; external usability testing scheduled. |
| Bugs-Less Grade | 74% | Known design defects tracked with owners; no critical blockers but partial template behaviour needs QA. |
| Test Grade | 45% | Research plan approved; moderated studies not yet started. |
| QA Grade | 42% | QA has roadmap but lacks component-level acceptance criteria. |
| Design Accuracy Grade | 66% | Most components synced with design system; responsive behaviour for tables pending documentation. |
| Overall Grade | 59% | Solid progress on navigation and homepage, but compliance, security, and imagery streams lag behind. |

## Next Steps
- Accelerate booking configurator rendering and document edge cases with engineering.
- Finalise legal copy and integrate into design files for compliance sign-off.
- Kick off moderated usability sessions to validate reworked flows and gather quantitative metrics.
