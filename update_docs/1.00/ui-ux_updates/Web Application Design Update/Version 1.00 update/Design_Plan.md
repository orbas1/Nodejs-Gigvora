# Web Application Design Plan – Version 1.00 Update

## Strategic Objectives
- **Convert visitors to engaged requesters** by spotlighting curated creators and simplifying the booking configurator.
- **Scale content operations** through modular templates that support seasonal themes, editorial takeovers, and co-branded experiences.
- **Improve accessibility and trust** with WCAG-compliant components, transparent policies, and structured testimonials.
- **Deliver consistent omni-channel experience** aligning web interactions with the refreshed mobile applications.

## Experience Blueprint
### Information Architecture & Navigation
- Mega-menu organised by primary categories (Events, Corporate, Personal, Emerging) with inline feature cards.
- Sticky utility bar for language selection, support, login, and wallet shortcuts.
- Contextual quick actions triggered via behavioural rules (e.g., returning customers see “Resume last brief”).

### Homepage & Landing Sections
1. **Hero & Theme Regions**
   - Supports themed overlays, background video, or illustration sets.
   - Dynamic CTA slots for “Book now”, “Explore creators”, or campaign-specific actions.
2. **Curated Collections**
   - Carousel modules linking to genre-specific listing pages.
   - Editorial banners with partial template injection for marketing content.
3. **Proof & Assurance**
   - Stacked testimonials, press logos, and metrics (completed gigs, NPS, satisfaction score).
4. **How It Works**
   - Three-step visual narrative with optional animations for each stage.

### Discovery & Listing Pages
- Responsive card grid with filters pinned on scroll for desktop; collapsible filters for mobile.
- Rich sorting (Recommended, Price, Response Time, Availability) with saved filter sets.
- Creator quick view modal containing pricing highlights, gallery, and CTA.

### Booking Flow
- Progressive disclosure layout with sticky order summary and validation states.
- Step indicator built into scroll snapping sections (Requirements, Schedule, Payment).
- Inline chat assist for clarifications and package adjustments.

### Support & Account Areas
- Redesigned dashboard showing upcoming gigs, invoices, and messages with embedded chat bubble trigger and unread counters.
- Unified settings pages for profile, notifications, payment methods, and security controls.
- Embedded help centre widgets with search, quick articles, and live support escalation; floating chat bubble persists across routes providing instant support escalation.
- Trust Center operations dashboard showcasing escrow KPIs, release queues, dispute workload, and evidence health messaging for finance/compliance teams.

## Design System Integration
- Token-driven theming (colour, typography, spacing, border radius, shadows) shared with mobile design library.
- Component inventory covering hero modules, cards, accordions, tables, alerts, forms, badges, and overlays.
- Motion guidelines specifying entrance/exit transitions, hover/active states, and async loading indicators.
- Iconography refresh using 24px grid with filled/outlined variants and defined fallback for smaller breakpoints.

## Accessibility & Compliance
- Compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA; mandatory focus-visible states, skip links, and ARIA labelling for interactive modules.
- Cookie consent, privacy, and terms updated with legal-approved copy and localisation.
- Secure payment copy and MFA prompts aligned with security team guidance.

## Content & Localisation
- Content style guide emphasising inclusive, action-oriented tone with global readability.
- Localisation ready components supporting RTL, double-byte characters, and multi-currency price displays.
- Editorial calendar for hero/collection swaps managed via CMS metadata.

## Rollout Phasing
- **Sprint 1**: IA validation, mega-menu prototypes, hero module variations.
- **Sprint 2**: Booking configurator redesign, responsive grid implementation.
- **Sprint 3**: Proof & support sections, account dashboard refresh, accessibility audit.
- **Sprint 4**: Pre-launch QA, analytics instrumentation, phased rollout strategy.

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| CMS limitations for modular hero content | High | Medium | Engage CMS vendor early, create fallback static templates, allocate dev time for API extensions. |
| Performance regression due to rich imagery | Medium | Medium | Implement image optimisation pipeline and lazy loading for below-the-fold modules. |
| Accessibility non-compliance | High | Low | Conduct interim audits and integrate axe automated testing within CI. |
| Scope creep from marketing requests | Medium | High | Establish content governance board and enforce template usage guidelines. |
