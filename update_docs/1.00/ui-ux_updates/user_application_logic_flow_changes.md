# User Application Logic Flow Changes – Task 3

## Bootstrap & Session Management
- Simplified startup by consolidating async providers into a staged pipeline: secure storage ➜ cached session ➜ runtime health ➜ feature flags ➜ analytics/push. Each stage exposes readiness signals to avoid blank screens and prevent premature logouts during transient outages.
- Adopted authenticated runtime health checks after cached tokens load to mitigate spoofing attempts and ensure maintenance notices display accurately.
- Added resilience guards so failed analytics/push onboarding fall back gracefully without blocking core navigation.

## Navigation & Role Switching
- Timeline becomes the default landing surface post-login; navigation state persists across sessions and synchronises with the web client via shared profile metadata.
- Role switcher now validates server-issued memberships before updating UI state, ensuring RBAC enforcement is consistent and audit logs capture every switch event.
- Implemented upgrade pathways: when a user without the necessary scope tries to access premium modules, the flow presents contextual education, pricing, and upgrade CTAs.

## Content Interaction & Recommendations
- Listing creation flows autosave drafts locally, sync to the Creation Studio once connectivity returns, and prompt for compliance confirmations before publishing.
- Matching recommendations surface explanation metadata (skills matched, timeline engagement) so users understand why content appears and can refine preferences.
- Activity feed interactions trigger analytics events and update the user’s goal tracker, keeping dashboards in sync across devices.

## Communication & Support
- Chat flows now initialise sockets only after session validation, display connection state toasts, and retry with exponential backoff on failures.
- Support ticket creation reuses Chatwoot sessions, attaching device diagnostics and recent error telemetry to expedite troubleshooting.
- Escalation pathways route incidents to operations when severity thresholds are met, with confirmations logged for auditing.

## Security & Compliance
- Privacy settings apply instantly via API calls wrapped in optimistic UI updates and rollback handlers if the backend rejects a change.
- Consent banner decisions persist per user/device with timestamped logs and sync to backend audit trails; revocations trigger immediate configuration updates.
- Device management allows remote logout and token revocation, ensuring stolen devices cannot retain offline access.

## Offline & Error Handling
- Introduced offline queues for timeline interactions, profile edits, and chat drafts with conflict resolution prompts when the device reconnects.
- Standardised error surfaces across modules with actionable messaging, retry buttons, and links to support or knowledge base articles.
- Added background refresh tasks that keep cached data fresh without blocking foreground interactions.
