# Application Design Update – Task List

## Task 1 – Audit Current Mobile Experience
- Inventory existing screens, flows, and reusable components.
- Map analytics data to identify drop-off and engagement hotspots.
- Document accessibility gaps (contrast, tap targets, screen reader support).
- Capture stakeholder feedback and outstanding product requirements.

## Task 2 – Redefine Information Architecture
- Facilitate card-sorting workshop with power users and internal stakeholders.
- Produce updated sitemap covering discovery, booking, messaging, wallet, and profile.
- Validate navigation flows with low-fidelity prototypes in quick user sessions.
- Finalise persistent navigation schema and contextual shortcuts.
- Align architecture with backend service availability and caching rules.

## Task 3 – Create Theme & Token System
- Audit existing colour, typography, spacing, and icon assets for reuse.
- Define master token set (base, semantic, contextual) with accessibility constraints.
- Prototype light, dark, and high-contrast variants across key layouts.
- Collaborate with engineering to export tokens into Flutter-compatible formats.
- Set up governance model for future theme contributions.

## Task 4 – Produce High-Fidelity Screens & Prototype
- Design high-fidelity screens for hero carousel, segmented feed, booking flow, and messaging hub.
- Integrate motion guidelines and micro-interactions within Figma prototype.
- Annotate states (default, hover, pressed, disabled, error) for interactive components.
- Conduct moderated usability tests with target personas.
- Capture findings and iterate on prototype prior to sign-off.

## Task 5 – Accessibility & Localisation Compliance
- Run accessibility checklist (contrast, text scaling, voice assistance) on updated designs.
- Define localisation expansion rules and create content length guardrails.
- Document voice-over scripts and alt text requirements for imagery.
- Partner with QA to translate accessibility requirements into test cases.

## Task 6 – Implementation Support & QA Handoff
- Prepare redlines, asset exports, and responsive specifications for engineering teams.
- Host design walkthroughs with iOS and Android squads to clarify edge cases.
- Establish bug triage process for design regressions during development.
- Review staging builds and log deviations against design source of truth.
- Sign off on release readiness alongside Product and QA leads.
