## Interaction Patterns
- Each section uses `SettingsToggleRow` or navigation rows with chevron.
- Sensitive actions (delete account) require confirm modal with red outline button `#DC2626`.
- Provide search field at top to filter settings (auto-scroll to matching items).

## State Management
- Use Riverpod state notifiers to persist preferences locally and sync with backend.
- Toggle updates send API request; show inline spinner while pending.
- Provide optimistic UI with fallback to revert on failure (toast message).

## Accessibility
- Switch controls labelled with additional context (e.g., "Push notifications for launchpad progress").
- Support dynamic type; rows expand to accommodate larger fonts.

## Navigation
- Access via profile overflow menu and from offline/error overlays for quick support.
