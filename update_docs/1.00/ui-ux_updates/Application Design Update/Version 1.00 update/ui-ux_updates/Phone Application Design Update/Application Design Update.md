# Phone Application Design Update – Version 1.00

## Executive Summary
The Version 1.00 refresh delivers an enterprise-ready Gigvora phone experience rooted in a unified blue-forward design system, responsive Flutter layouts, and highly-instrumented interaction logic. This documentation translates the shared design language captured in the master UI/UX logs into screen-precise specifications so engineering and creative partners can execute without ambiguity.

- **Primary objectives:** accelerate opportunity discovery, highlight community momentum, and streamline contribution flows (Launchpad, Volunteering) while maintaining accessibility and offline resilience.
- **Design pillars:** focus (signal-over-noise layouts), credibility (trustworthy visual hierarchy, professional typography), and empowerment (actionable CTAs, analytics-driven feedback loops).
- **Delivery scope:** feed, explorer, marketplace verticals, launchpad, volunteering, profile, notifications, settings, support, authentication, admin entry, and core widgets.

## Experience Blueprint
1. **Information Architecture:** Bottom navigation hosts six anchors (Feed, Explorer, Marketplace hub, Launchpad, Volunteering, Profile). Floating global actions and contextual drawers expose secondary workflows.
2. **Layout System:** 8px base grid with responsive breakpoints for mobile portrait (360–430dp), small tablets (600dp navigation rail variant), and large tablets (840dp dual pane). Max content width for cards is capped at 344dp to preserve reachability.
3. **Theming Tokens:** Shared color and typography tokens align with the global design change log (primary `#2563EB`, deep accent `#1D4ED8`, neutral slate ramp `#0F172A`–`#CBD5F5`, success `#16A34A`, warning `#F59E0B`, error `#DC2626`, background `#F8FAFC`). Text styles leverage Inter in sizes 12–32 with weight ramp 400–700.
4. **Motion & Feedback:** Micro-interactions capped at 180–220ms with curve `(0.4, 0.0, 0.2, 1)` for standard transitions and spring `(0.2, 0.8, 0.2)` for card lifts. Haptics triggered on major CTAs, toggles, and offline alerts.
5. **Accessibility:** Minimum 4.5:1 contrast, 44dp tappable controls, TalkBack-friendly semantics, dynamic type scaling up to 120%, offline/off-error banners pronounced with iconography.

## Documentation Structure
This package splits into the following modules:
- **Screen Updates:** granular screen blueprints, flow diagrams, widget inventories, imagery requirements, text copy, and button catalogue.
- **Logic & Functional Updates:** flow sequencing, map overlays, decision logic for data states, error handling.
- **Design & Styling Updates:** typography, color, spacing, form, and card systems with production-ready specifications.
- **Data & Navigation Requirements:** dummy payload structures, menu taxonomies, settings controls.
- **Overarching Briefs:** summary of intended impact, dependencies, and rationale for creative decisions.

Cross-reference with the master `design_change_log.md` and `user_app_wireframe_changes.md` to ensure parity between high-level strategy and this execution-level brief.
