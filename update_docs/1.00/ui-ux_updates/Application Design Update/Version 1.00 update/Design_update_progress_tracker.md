# Application Design Update – Progress Tracker

| Metric | Score (0-100%) | Evidence / Commentary |
|--------|----------------|-----------------------|
| Design Quality Grade | 68% | 22-screen audit quantified gaps and prioritised remediation across navigation, feed, and marketplace flows. |
| Design Organisation Grade | 74% | Screen/component inventory refreshed; documentation cross-linked for engineering readiness. |
| Design Position Grade | 58% | Stakeholder objectives (onboarding, compliance messaging) logged to sharpen discovery vs. booking narrative. |
| Design Text Grade | 60% | Compliance/legal copy requirements captured for offline/error overlays; localisation guardrails next. |
| Design Colour Grade | 64% | Token exploration covers light/dark schemes; high-contrast palette awaiting accessibility review. |
| Design Render Grade | 50% | Only 40% of hero states rendered in high fidelity; motion specs pending. |
| Compliance Grade | 52% | Accessibility audit gaps (semantics, focus order, contrast) documented with owners and timelines. |
| Security Grade | 52% | Biometric and sensitive data screens identified, yet security review not scheduled. |
| Design Functionality Grade | 62% | Flow health assessment outlines CTA dead-ends and navigation debt with action owners. |
| Design Images Grade | 52% | Placeholder imagery flagged for replacement; asset sourcing backlog prioritised. |
| Design Usability Grade | 61% | Analytics drop-offs quantified to steer usability studies and onboarding experiments. |
| Bugs-Less Grade | 70% | Known design debt items documented with owners; zero blocking defects yet but validation ongoing. |
| Test Grade | 55% | Analytics baselines + instrumentation notes prepared; moderated test protocol next sprint. |
| QA Grade | 45% | QA looped in via audit notes; awaiting detailed acceptance criteria. |
| Design Accuracy Grade | 65% | Audit reconciled specs with widgets; nav + CTA semantics logged for update. |
| Overall Grade | 60% | Production-level audit completed; focus shifts to execution and compliance follow-through. |

## Task Progress Snapshot (Phone Application Track)
| Task | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Task 1 – Audit Current Mobile Experience | 100% | Findings documented in Application Design Update, Screens List, Logic Flow Assessment, and Design Plan integration section. |

## Next Steps
- Implement persistent bottom navigation prototype aligned with audit findings and menu_drawings.md specs.
- Deliver accessibility remediation backlog (semantics, contrast tokens, focus traps) ahead of M2 sign-off.
- Schedule moderated usability sessions focused on feed onboarding and explorer search drop-offs using new analytics baselines.
- Prepare QA acceptance criteria covering hero carousel, marketplace CTA flows, and offline/legal copy requirements.
