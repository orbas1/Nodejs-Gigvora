# Application Design Update â€“ Progress Tracker

| Metric | Score (0-100%) | Evidence / Commentary |
|--------|----------------|-----------------------|
| Design Quality Grade | 62% | Core journeys mapped but hero carousel visual polish still mid-fidelity; requires iconography overhaul. |
| Design Organisation Grade | 68% | Updated IA drafts exist, however component library re-tagging still in progress. |
| Design Position Grade | 55% | New positioning for discovery vs. booking articulated, yet competitive differentiation narrative not fully documented. |
| Design Text Grade | 58% | Microcopy guidelines drafted, but tone frameworks need localisation validation. |
| Design Colour Grade | 64% | Token exploration covers light/dark schemes; high-contrast palette awaiting accessibility review. |
| Design Render Grade | 50% | Only 40% of hero states rendered in high fidelity; motion specs pending. |
| Compliance Grade | 46% | Accessibility audit planned but not executed; legal copy updates outstanding. |
| Security Grade | 52% | Biometric and sensitive data screens identified, yet security review not scheduled. |
| Design Functionality Grade | 60% | Booking stepper defined conceptually but lacks error-state mapping for payments. |
| Design Images Grade | 48% | Placeholder imagery in use; brand-approved asset library not integrated. |
| Design Usability Grade | 57% | Guerrilla testing surfaced navigation clarity gains; full usability study scheduled for next sprint. |
| Bugs-Less Grade | 70% | Known design debt items documented with owners; zero blocking defects yet but validation ongoing. |
| Test Grade | 40% | Only draft usability protocol exists; no formal tests executed. |
| QA Grade | 38% | QA alignment meeting pending; test cases not authored. |
| Design Accuracy Grade | 63% | Alignment between Figma and specification mostly consistent, minor component variance noted. |
| Overall Grade | 56% | Solid architectural direction established, but compliance, imagery, and testing workstreams lagging. |

## Next Steps
- Prioritise accessibility and compliance review sessions to raise compliance/security scores.
- Accelerate high-fidelity rendering pipeline with dedicated illustration support.
- Finalise usability research plan and begin moderated sessions to validate navigation changes.
