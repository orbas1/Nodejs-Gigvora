# Application Design Update â€“ Change Log

## Summary of Design Adjustments
- Adopted a modular home experience with themed hero cards to surface featured gigs, seasonal campaigns, and curated playlists.
- Refined navigation architecture by separating discovery, booking, and account management into persistent bottom-bar segments.
- Introduced dynamic theming tokens (light, dark, and high-contrast) that cascade across typography, iconography, and interactive elements.
- Standardised micro-interaction patterns for booking confirmations, chat replies, and gig status updates using platform-native motion curves.
