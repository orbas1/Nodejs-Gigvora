# User Application Styling Changes â€“ Task 3

The Flutter user application now mirrors the refreshed web design system so end users experience a cohesive Gigvora brand across every surface. Key improvements include:

## Design Tokens & Theming
- Implemented semantic colour tokens (`primary`, `secondary`, `success`, `danger`, `surface`, `surfaceElevated`, `overlay`) with both light and dark palettes that auto-adjust to system preferences while respecting accessibility contrast thresholds.
- Normalised typography scales (Display, Heading, Title, Body, Caption) using shared font families and letter spacing taken from the React token catalogue; all widgets consume the tokens through theme extensions to avoid divergence.
- Standardised spacing, radius, and elevation tokens so cards, chips, and drawers render with the same rounded geometry and soft shadows introduced on the web app.

## Layout & Component Styling
- Rebuilt the global scaffold to support an adaptive sidebar/tab bar that honours role RBAC: admin roles receive persistent navigation rails while freelancers view a condensed bottom navigation with prominent Creation Studio access.
- Updated primary call-to-action buttons with gradient backgrounds, focus rings, and loading spinners that match the React component states; destructive actions use the new danger palette and require double confirmation.
- Introduced timeline-specific cards with elevated headers, contextual tag pills, and consistent iconography so the timeline rename feels deliberate throughout feed, detail, and notification views.

## Accessibility & Motion
- Added high-contrast focus highlights, reduced motion settings (disabling hero animations when `MediaQuery.of(context).disableAnimations` is true), and larger hit targets for tappable elements to meet WCAG 2.2 AA requirements on mobile.
- Enabled text scaling across all core screens without clipping by refactoring layout builders and adopting flexible grid spacing utilities.

## Media & Micro-Interactions
- Implemented shimmer placeholders and image aspect-ratio guards for timeline media, proposals, and portfolio items to prevent layout shifts while content loads over variable network conditions.
- Refined toast/snackbar styling with consistent iconography, gradient overlays, and action button alignment so success, warning, and error states remain recognisable.

## System Integrations
- Embedded chat/inbox, moderation alerts, and finance prompts with consistent badge styling and severity colours derived from the design tokens, ensuring parity with the admin dashboards.
- Applied secure avatar fallbacks and initials rendering so no personally identifiable information leaks when users opt into privacy mode; uses the same hashing logic as the backend to select placeholder imagery.

These styling upgrades guarantee the mobile experience remains production-ready, performant, and visually aligned with the refreshed Gigvora brand while respecting RBAC-driven navigation and accessibility best practices.
