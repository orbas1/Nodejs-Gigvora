## Web App Wireframe Changes

- Main layout overlay now reserves space for the Chatwoot support bubble so authenticated screens illustrate the floating launcher anchored above the messaging dock.
- Admin moderation wireframes now depict overview metrics, queue tables with status badges, and a right-hand audit timeline drawer to guide UI implementation and QA references.
