## Web App Wireframe Changes

The latest wireframes incorporate the full Gigvora 1.00 experience overhaul and align with RBAC-driven journeys.

### Marketing & Acquisition Surfaces
- **Homepage Hero & Navigator:** Hero blocks now feature gradient-backed storytelling with callouts for Creator, Business, and Talent personas. A persistent journey navigator in the header wires to pricing, demos, and knowledge centre entries.
- **Pricing & Plan Selector:** Wireframes introduce comparison tables with toggles for monthly/annual billing, contextual tooltips, and finance trust badges linked to the unified wallet/escrow stack.
- **Resource Library:** Knowledge centre and blog layouts now expose filter sidebars, search, and author spotlights; footers include legal/policy quick links to satisfy compliance requirements.

### Authenticated Dashboards
- **Role Landing Screens:** Each persona (Admin Operations, Project/Gig Management, Talent Insights, Provider/Serviceman, Finance & Analytics, Community Moderation) lands on a dashboard wireframe that surfaces role-appropriate KPIs, quick actions, and alerts. Role switching is positioned in the global header with clear RBAC boundaries.
- **Unified Workspace Canvas:** Project, gig, and client workspaces adopt a kanban/analytics hybrid wireframe with tabs for Timeline, Brief, Files, Financials, and Support so teams can pivot without leaving the workspace.
- **Finance Hub:** Finance wireframes consolidate revenue metrics, escrow balances, payout schedules, and compliance warnings with export buttons wired to the reporting service.

### Community & Live Services
- **Inbox & Chat Console:** Wireframes show a split-pane layout with conversation lists, SLA badges, escalation controls, and Chatwoot-powered support bubble states. Moderators can toggle between chat queues, moderation feed, and incident timeline.
- **Events & Live Sessions:** Scheduling pages provide calendar layouts, host controls, RSVP insights, and integration callouts for Google/Outlook sync. Sidebars expose recommended talent powered by the matching engine.

### Policy & Compliance
- **Policy Acknowledgement Modal:** Every high-risk workflow wireframe includes a reusable modal for consent capture, linking to Terms, Privacy, Refund, and Community Guidelines. Confirmation states feed into the policy acknowledgement audit trail.
- **Security Settings:** Account security and RBAC management wireframes now include multi-factor status, session management, role grants, and audit logs tied to backend governance models.

These wireframes provide engineering, QA, and content teams with concrete guidance for layout, copy regions, and interaction patterns, ensuring production-ready handoff with no ambiguity across marketing, application, and admin experiences.
