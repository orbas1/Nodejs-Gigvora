# Web App Wireframe Updates â€” Platform Hardening

- Added a dedicated "Runtime" navigation branch in the admin mega menu wireframe, exposing Operations Console, Config History,
  and Audit Trail screens.
- The Operations Console wireframe now includes stacked sections: `Overview` (health summary), `Queues` (sortable table with
  pagination controls), `Workers` (status chips), and `Maintenance Notices` (timeline of upcoming windows).
- Annotated states for healthy, degraded, and outage scenarios with corresponding banner messaging and button disablement rules.
