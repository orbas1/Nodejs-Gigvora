# UI & UX Design Change Log â€“ Task 3

- Introduced a reusable design token layer (typography, colour, spacing, radius, shadows) via CSS variables to unify theming across responsive breakpoints.
- Refined default gradients/backgrounds to support high-contrast selections and consistent branding for marketing and authenticated surfaces.
- Updated primary navigation layouts with mega menu cards, iconography, and uppercase cues that match the Gigvora 1.00 enterprise visual language.
- Extended the admin operations design kit with moderation analytics cards, queue tables, and audit timelines that align with the enterprise dashboard patterns introduced in Task 3.
