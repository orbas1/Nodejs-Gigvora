# Web Application Styling Changes â€“ Task 3

The React front-end adopts a production-ready design system that balances aesthetics, performance, and accessibility.

## Design System Tokens
- Adopted CSS variable tokens for fonts, spacing, radii, shadows, and colour surfaces, allowing component teams to extend the system without duplicating Tailwind overrides. Tokens map directly to the shared design kit for parity with mobile.
- Introduced semantic elevation layers and border treatments so cards, drawers, and mega menus share consistent depth cues across light and dark modes.

## Global Treatments
- Applied smooth scrolling, refined gradients, and selection styling to enhance accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.2 focus/contrast alignment). Focus states use 3px outlines with accessible colours and animation respects reduced-motion preferences.
- Updated background textures and radial gradients for hero sections, timeline headers, and dashboard highlights, ensuring quick loading via CSS-only solutions and avoiding large image payloads.

## Component Refinements
- Redesigned navigation bars and mega menus with responsive spacing, iconography alignment, and pinned CTA buttons. Dropdowns now respect viewport height and include scroll shadows for clarity.
- Implemented timeline-specific cards with gradient headers, status badges, and micro-interaction hover states; badges inherit severity colours shared with moderation tooling.
- Refreshed modal, toast, and drawer styling to include layered shadows, glassmorphism overlays, and consistent close affordances while maintaining keyboard accessibility.

## Accessibility & Performance
- Expanded colour palette to include AAA-compliant options and validated them with automated contrast testing in CI. Each palette variant includes explicit tokens for text, border, and surface states.
- Minified custom fonts through variable font usage, deferred non-critical CSS, and adopted container queries to reduce layout shifts and improve Core Web Vitals.

## Integration Touchpoints
- Styled Chatwoot widget overrides to blend with Gigvora colours, ensuring support flows feel native. Widgets load lazily after consent banners resolve to satisfy privacy requirements.
- Updated finance analytics charts with high-contrast line/bar styling, accessible legends, and tooltip animations tuned for assistive technologies.

These styling updates produce a polished, brand-aligned web experience that meets enterprise accessibility, performance, and compliance expectations while supporting every new dashboard and workflow introduced in Version 1.00.
