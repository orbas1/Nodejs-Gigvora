# Web Application Logic Flow Changes â€“ Task 3

- Added role-switching logic and navigation mapping utilities (`resolvePrimaryNavigation`, `resolvePrimaryRoleKey`, `buildRoleOptions`) ensuring authenticated flows land on the correct dashboards before exposing timeline content.
- Embedded policy acknowledgement gating into the main layout to capture legal consent prior to interacting with messaging, studio, and financial modules.
- Updated engagement prompts and moderation errors to reference the Timeline, keeping copy and analytics consistent across all surfaces.
