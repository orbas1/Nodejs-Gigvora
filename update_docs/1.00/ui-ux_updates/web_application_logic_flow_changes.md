# Web Application Logic Flow Changes â€“ Version 1.00

## Routing & Layout
1. **Route configuration:** `App.jsx` maps main layout routes for home, auth, discovery, marketplace, community, and admin login, ensuring shared header/footer across primary experiences.
2. **Layout shell:** `MainLayout.jsx` wraps pages with gradient background, sticky header, and footer, maintaining visual continuity and scroll position handling.
3. **Navigation state:** `Header.jsx` tracks mobile menu state, applies active nav underline, and surfaces login/register CTAs.

## Homepage Composition
1. **Hero narrative:** `HeroSection.jsx` pairs marketing messaging with live feed preview, CTA buttons, and metrics to orient visitors.
2. **Value proof:** Components such as `FeatureGrid`, `MomentumSection`, and `OpportunitySections` stack to articulate benefits and surface deep links.
3. **Social proof:** `TestimonialsSection` and `CTASection` convert interest into action through trust signals and clear CTAs.

## Authentication Flows
1. **Login/Register:** Dedicated pages present forms with validation, helper text, and route to backend auth endpoints.
2. **Company registration:** Additional fields capture organisation data; flow highlights compliance requirements before completion.
3. **Admin login:** Standalone page emphasises security protocols and gating for internal staff.

## Feed Experience
1. **Data rendering:** Feed page fetches curated posts, displays cards with engagement actions, and surfaces trending widgets.
2. **Filtering:** Chip controls adjust feed scope (All, Opportunities, Launchpad, Groups) and update list accordingly.
3. **Contribution:** CTA opens composer for sharing updates, aligning with community-first strategy.

## Search / Explorer Logic
1. **State management:** `SearchPage.jsx` combines `useCachedResource` and `useDebounce` to handle snapshots and typed queries with caching TTLs.
2. **Category handling:** Results partitioned by category, each using tailored metadata renderers for cards.
3. **Analytics instrumentation:** Search interactions track queries, filters, and result openings via analytics service.
4. **Status feedback:** `DataStatus` component communicates loading, cache usage, last-updated timestamp, and refresh actions.

## Marketplace Pages (Jobs/Gigs/Projects/Launchpad/Volunteering)
1. **Shared sections:** Each page reuses hero, filter controls, and list components to maintain familiarity.
2. **Opportunity cards:** Present summary info, meta chips, and primary CTAs (Apply, Pitch, Join) to convert interest into action.
3. **Support modules:** Side panels display stats, tips, or recommended actions to guide users.

## Projects & Collaboration
1. **Projects page:** Highlights project management features, offers quick access to boards, chat, and file sharing.
2. **Launchpad & Volunteering:** Provide curated programs and missions with filterable cards and CTAs for registration or commitment.
3. **Groups & Connections:** Encourage community building with join/invite flows and suggestions.

## Profile & Personalisation
1. **Dynamic sections:** Profile page aggregates about info, experience, portfolio, launchpad achievements, volunteering history, and recommendations.
2. **Actionable CTAs:** Buttons for messaging, inviting to projects, endorsing skills, and sharing profile link.
3. **Contextual modules:** Sidebar surfaces contact details, badges, and quick share actions.

## Responsiveness & Accessibility
1. **Responsive classes:** Tailwind utilities adapt layout for mobile/desktop, ensuring nav collapse and card stacking.
2. **Accessibility features:** Semantic headings, focus outlines, ARIA labels, and high-contrast accent usage maintain compliance.
3. **Performance cues:** Lazy loading, skeletons, and caching reduce perceived latency while analytics capture usage patterns.
