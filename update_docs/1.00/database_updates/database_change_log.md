# Database Change Log â€” Task 2 Completion

## Governance & Integrity Enhancements
- Introduced migration `20241120100000-database-governance-upgrade.cjs` enforcing unique persona ownership, cascading foreign keys, hashed multi-factor tokens, and MySQL-safe precision for rate fields.
- Hardened health instrumentation to stream pool saturation, isolation level, replication role, and migration drift metadata to runtime observability.
- Added automated schema export (`npm run schema:export`) delivering JSON snapshots plus SHA-256 checksums for downstream contract and Hive validation.
- Delivered secure backup/restore automation via `scripts/databaseBackup.js` supporting AES-256-GCM encryption, gzip compression, and integrity verification.

## Seed Data Delivery
- Published production-grade persona dataset (`20241120103000-foundational-persona-seed.cjs`) covering admin, freelancer, agency, company, mentor, and volunteer flows with aligned pricing tiers, skill taxonomies, and launchpad/volunteering records for UX smoke tests.
- Seed packs populate gigs, jobs, projects, launchpads, volunteering roles, feed posts, groups, and social connections to exercise dashboards, recommendations, and policy acknowledgements.

## Operational Outcomes
- Database lifecycle service now emits deterministic drift alerts when migration inventory diverges from filesystem, supporting deployment gates and incident response.
- Backup metadata files include encryption fingerprints, file size, and SHA-256 digests so operations can attest to compliance requirements.
