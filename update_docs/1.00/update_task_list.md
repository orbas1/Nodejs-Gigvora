# Version 1.00 Task List

All tasks derive from the feature requirements and remediation directives captured in `new_feature_brief.md`, `features_update_plan.md`, `features_to_add.md`, `issue_report.md`, `issue_list.md`, and `fix_suggestions.md`. Percentages currently reflect a planning baseline (0%).

## Task 1 – Platform Bootstrap & Security Hardening (100%)
**Goal:** Resolve backend startup instability, configuration drift, security exposures, and observability gaps before feature work scales.

### Subtasks (100% each)
