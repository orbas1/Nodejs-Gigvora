# Version 1.00 Task List

All tasks derive from the feature requirements and remediation directives captured in `new_feature_brief.md`, `features_update_plan.md`, `features_to_add.md`, `issue_report.md`, `issue_list.md`, and `fix_suggestions.md`. Progress reflects the current production-ready state after implementation.

## Task 1 – Platform Bootstrap & Security Hardening (100%)
**Goal:** Resolve backend startup instability, configuration drift, security exposures, and observability gaps before feature work scales.

### Subtasks (100% each)

3. Implemented schema-validated configuration management (defaults, runtime inspection console, hot reload) covering ports, rate limits, SSL, CSP, and feature toggles.
4. Standardised logging and correlation IDs across HTTP and worker processes, removing ad-hoc console output and enforcing secure CSP headers.
5. Published operator runbooks plus CI gates that validate environment files, port alignment, and observability wiring before deployments.
