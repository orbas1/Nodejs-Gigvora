- **Entry Criteria:** Stakeholder approval of task scope, environment inventory completed, credentials secured for required integrations.
- **Exit Criteria:** Automated smoke tests confirm stable startup/shutdown, authenticated health dashboards live in staging, CSP hardened, and runbooks published. ✅ Achieved via runtime-config validation script, secured `/health` endpoints, and updated operator runbook.
- **Dependencies:** Access to infrastructure environments, participation from DevOps/security teams.

## Milestone 2 – Data Integrity & Contract Alignment (100%)
**Covers:** Task 2 – Database Governance & Data Integrity.

- **Objectives:** Retrofit migrations with security/compliance controls, deliver seed data and schema artifacts, and align shared contracts across services.

- **Entry Criteria:** Milestone 1 exit, DBA availability, staging MySQL instance ready, shared-contracts repo ready for regeneration.
- **Exit Criteria:** Migrations run cleanly in CI and staging, seed data populates explorers/dashboards, schema snapshots distributed to mobile/backend teams, backups tested successfully. ✅ Achieved via OTP hardening migration, schema/export automation, encrypted backup tooling, and production-ready persona datasets powering marketplace QA.
- **Dependencies:** CI infrastructure for MySQL tests, collaboration with mobile team for Hive alignment.

## Milestone 3 – Experience, Navigation & Policy Delivery (100%)
**Covers:** Task 3 – Experience, Navigation & Policy Overhaul.

- **Objectives:** Implement design system upgrades, navigation revamp, policy integration, and creation studio enhancements across web and mobile while completing the full website UI refresh for every page, screen, and dashboard.
- **Key Deliverables:** Updated React/Flutter components, role-aware mega menus, timeline rename, policy acknowledgement storage, refreshed marketing/informational pages, global design tokenisation, and prominent Creation Studio entry points backed by authenticated routing.
- **Entry Criteria:** Design assets approved, backend configuration APIs from Milestone 1 available, database extensions from Milestone 2 deployed.
- **Exit Criteria:** UX acceptance reviews signed off, automated/UI tests green, policy pages published with SEO metadata, wizard scoring endpoints operational. ✅ Achieved via design token rollout, mega menu navigation, timeline terminology migration, and policy acknowledgement banner with persistent consent storage.
- **Dependencies:** Design team for assets, content/legal teams for policy copy, analytics instrumentation from Task 1/2.

## Milestone 4 – Community, Intelligence & Monetisation Enablement (40%)
**Covers:** Task 4 – Community, Communication & Live Services and Task 5 – Intelligence, Monetisation & Dashboard Unification.

- **Validation:** Targeted realtime Jest suites (`channelRegistry`, `connectionRegistry`) executed with `SKIP_SEQUELIZE_BOOTSTRAP=true` to confirm channel RBAC and connection limits after test harness refactors.
- **Entry Criteria:** Milestones 1–3 exits, Chatwoot/Firebase/HubSpot credentials provisioned, schema tables for chat and monetisation in place.
- **Exit Criteria:** Load/stress testing thresholds met, explainability outputs validated, finance dashboards reconciled with seed transactions, moderation workflows audited, A/B testing harness operational.
- **Dependencies:** Security review for sockets, finance/legal stakeholders, analytics team for telemetry dashboards.

## Milestone 5 – Quality Assurance, Documentation & Release (0%)
**Covers:** Task 6 – Cross-Platform Quality Assurance & Release Governance.

- **Objectives:** Complete automated and manual testing, finalise documentation, prepare deployment automation, and compile release reporting artifacts.
- **Key Deliverables:** CI gates across repos, device farm results, accessibility and performance audits, deployment scripts/UI, change_log.md, end_of_update_report.md, upload_brief.md, stakeholder sign-offs.
- **Entry Criteria:** Milestones 1–4 exits, QA environments stable, documentation drafts available for review.
