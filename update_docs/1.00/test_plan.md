# Version 1.00 â€“ Test Plan Update

## Scope
- **Flutter mobile quality gates** now run on every push/PR through GitHub Actions. The workflow executes `melos run analyze`, unit suites (foundation package logic, widget rendering), golden-filtered suites, and the new integration smoke test that boots `GigvoraApp` with mocked services.
- **Codemagic release workflow** reuses the same test scripts before producing store-ready artefacts, ensuring production builds are blocked until automated verification passes.

## Test Coverage Additions
- Added deterministic unit tests for `AppConfig` to validate environment helpers and copy-with overrides used across the mobile bootstrap pipeline.
- Introduced widget tests for `GigvoraApp` covering loading and resolved theme states with Riverpod overrides.
- Implemented an integration test booting the application shell via `integration_test`, proving navigation wiring survives dependency overrides and enabling future end-to-end expansion.

## Execution Strategy
- GitHub Actions publishes coverage artefacts (`**/coverage/lcov.info`) for ingestion by SonarQube and internal dashboards. Failures on any analysis or test step block merges.
- Codemagic uses secure environment groups (`gigvora-android-signing`, `gigvora-ios-signing`, `gigvora-distribution`) to access signing assets and distribution credentials, guaranteeing that only tested builds reach TestFlight and Play Internal Testing.
- Local developers can reproduce the CI steps with `melos run ci:verify`, aligning workstation and pipeline checks.

## Next Steps
- Extend the integration test suite to cover GraphQL failure handling and realtime reconnection telemetry as backend mocks become available.
- Add golden baselines for redesigned dashboards once finalised by design, enabling the CI golden stage to protect layout fidelity.
