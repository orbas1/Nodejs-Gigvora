# Version 1.00 Test Plan â€” Task 1 Execution Summary

## Automated Tests
- **Backend:** `pnpm run test:lifecycle` covering runtime orchestrator state machine, configuration validation failure paths, and
  worker shutdown registry. `pnpm run test:health` hits `/v1/ops/health/ready` with valid/invalid tokens, verifying pagination and
  ServiceUnavailableError payloads. `pnpm run test:config-console` ensures `/ops/config` responses mask secrets.
- **Frontend:** Playwright suite `ops-console.spec.ts` validates SSE rendering, degraded state banners, configuration reload flow,
  and navigation guards. Jest component tests cover token refresh hook and fallback UI.
- **Mobile:** Flutter integration tests simulate diagnostics polling, offline caching, and maintenance notice acknowledgement.

## Manual Testing
- Ops walkthrough verifying configuration reload triggers worker refresh without restart.
- Security review of CSP headers and request ID generation under Chrome DevTools security tab.
- Mobile QA verifying diagnostics screen renders on iOS/Android and respects accessibility (VoiceOver/TalkBack).

## Regression
- Smoke test of timeline, authentication, and standard dashboards to ensure platform hardening changes did not regress user flows.
- Load test hitting `/v1/ops/health/ready` at production cadence to confirm performance and rate limiting.
