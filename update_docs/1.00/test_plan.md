# Gigvora Version 1.00 Test Plan

## 1. Introduction
The purpose of this test plan is to validate that Gigvora Version 1.00 ships as a production-ready multi-platform release. The plan covers backend, web, mobile, realtime, data, and infrastructure layers with emphasis on RBAC fidelity, CORS safety, payment integrity, and cross-surface parity.

## 2. Scope
- **In Scope:** Web (React) application, Flutter mobile apps, Node.js backend services, realtime namespaces, data pipelines, analytics, payments/escrow, Chatwoot support integration, deployment automation, documentation validation.
- **Out of Scope:** Legacy marketing microsites scheduled for retirement post-1.00, deprecated API endpoints flagged for removal, third-party marketplace plugins not bundled with the release.

## 3. Test Objectives
1. Confirm critical persona journeys (provider, serviceman, freelancer, mentor, agency, company, volunteer, administrator) execute without blockers.
2. Validate RBAC and consent flows so users see only authorised data and are offered upgrade paths when access is restricted.
3. Ensure CORS policies, rate limits, and security headers are consistent across environments and block disallowed origins while supporting approved clients.
4. Verify deployment, rollback, and monitoring workflows to guarantee operational readiness.
5. Provide documented evidence of test execution for compliance and stakeholder review.

## 4. Test Items
- Backend REST & realtime endpoints (Express controllers, Socket namespaces).
- Frontend modules: dashboards, profiles, creation studio, timeline, inbox, finance, analytics, admin moderation, telemetry panel.
- Mobile features: authentication, timeline, dashboards, messaging, notifications, offline caches.
- Data artefacts: migrations, seed scripts, analytics exports.
- Infrastructure scripts: deployment automation, environment configuration validators, monitoring dashboards.

## 5. Test Approach
### 5.1 Manual Testing
- Persona-based exploratory sessions covering top 10 flows per role with accessibility, localisation, and error-path validation.
- Compliance reviews of policy acknowledgement banner, legal pages, and consent logging.
- Visual regression sampling for responsive breakpoints and dark/light theme parity.

### 5.2 Automated Testing
- **Backend:** Jest-based unit and integration suites, supertest API contract checks, RBAC & CORS regression tests, database migration smoke tests.
- **Frontend:** React Testing Library unit tests, Cypress end-to-end suites for key journeys, Lighthouse performance budget checks.
- **Mobile:** Flutter widget tests, integration tests driven by `melos run ci:verify`, golden tests for critical screens, Firebase Test Lab smoke runs.
- **Shared:** Contract validation between backend OpenAPI specs/shared SDKs and frontend/mobile clients; static analysis (ESLint, TypeScript, Dart analysis, Swift/Kotlin lint when applicable).

### 5.3 Non-Functional Testing
- Load testing for timeline, chat, and inbox endpoints to confirm <2s P95 latency under defined concurrency.
- Security testing: penetration test scripts targeting authentication, RBAC escalations, CORS misconfigurations, file upload sanitisation, and rate limiting.
- Resilience testing: chaos drills for worker restarts, database failover simulations, and websocket reconnect behaviour.

## 6. Test Environment
- **Staging:** Mirrors production topology with feature flags enabled for release candidates, seeded anonymised data, instrumentation to capture telemetry.
- **Performance:** Scaled-down environment for load/chaos tests with traffic generation tooling.
- **Local Sandboxes:** Developer-configurable environment using docker-compose scripts and seeded fixtures for rapid validation.
- All environments enforce HTTPS, strict CSP, HSTS, and aligned port configurations (API 5000, Web 4000 behind proxy) to prevent mismatch.

## 7. Test Data Management
- Synthetic but production-shaped datasets covering each persona, payment scenarios, dispute states, and moderation events.
- Secure storage of secrets with rotation tracked in the configuration charter.
- Automated reset scripts to restore known-good states after destructive tests.

## 8. Roles & Responsibilities
| Role | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| QA Lead | Owns test execution schedule, sign-off criteria, and defect triage board. |
| Backend Engineer | Maintains API test suites, fixes blocking defects, reviews security findings. |
| Frontend Engineer | Maintains React unit/E2E suites, addresses UX bugs, ensures accessibility compliance. |
| Mobile Engineer | Maintains Flutter tests, coordinates Firebase Test Lab runs, validates store readiness. |
| DevOps Engineer | Oversees deployment tests, monitors infrastructure metrics, validates rollback scripts. |
| Product Manager | Prioritises defects, validates acceptance criteria, communicates status to stakeholders. |
| Compliance Officer | Reviews policy acknowledgements, data retention, and audit evidence. |

## 9. Test Schedule
1. **Week 1:** Finalise test cases, prepare environments, complete smoke runs.
2. **Week 2:** Execute automated regression suites, start manual persona walkthroughs.
3. **Week 3:** Conduct performance, security, and resilience testing; remediate high-severity issues.
4. **Week 4:** Regression retests, compliance sign-off, release readiness review, generate final report.

## 10. Entry & Exit Criteria
- **Entry:** Code freeze in place, environments stable, test data refreshed, all blockers resolved.
- **Exit:** 0 open critical defects, all high severity issues mitigated or deferred with approval, regression suites green, performance/security thresholds met, documentation updated (change log, progress tracker, release notes).

## 11. Risk Management
- Highlighted risks include third-party integration instability, store review delays, and environment drift. Mitigation strategies: feature flags, contingency release slots, configuration validation scripts, and multi-region testing.

## 12. Reporting
- Daily test status reports shared via Slack and Confluence with defect burndown charts and coverage summaries.
- Final test summary document stored alongside update_progress_tracker.md with links to automated run artifacts, manual checklists, and compliance evidence.
