## API Integration Changes

- Connected the support stack to Chatwoot by introducing runtime-configured identity signing, REST session provisioning, and webhook ingestion so third-party conversations hydrate Gigvora support cases without manual intervention.
- Wired admin clients to the moderation REST surface, allowing dashboards to fetch queue/overview data and resolve events while maintaining SLA metadata and audit trails.
