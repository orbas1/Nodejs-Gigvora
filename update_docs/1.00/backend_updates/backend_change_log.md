# Backend Change Log â€” Task 1 Completion

- Consolidated server bootstrap into `runtimeOrchestrator` with event-driven startup/shutdown, preventing duplicate worker
  registration and ensuring partial failures unwind cleanly.
- Delivered schema-validated configuration with Zod-backed `runtimeConfig`, `.env.template`, and CI validation to block drift.
- Hardened health endpoints (`/health/live`, `/health/ready`, `/health/metrics`) with authentication, pagination, queue depth
  reporting, and structured `ServiceUnavailableError` responses.
- Standardised logging and correlation IDs via the new request context middleware, shared logger factory, and CSP nonce policy.
- Added operator tooling: ops console routes, lifecycle event stream, runbooks, PagerDuty hooks, and automated readiness tests in
  CI.
