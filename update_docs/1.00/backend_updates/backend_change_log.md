## Platform Bootstrap & Security Hardening Summary

- Delivered single-pass server bootstrap orchestration with deterministic worker startup/rollback, ensuring database pools and metrics exporters initialise exactly once.
- Introduced authenticated, paginated readiness endpoints and secured metrics streaming via bearer tokens aligned with the runtime configuration.
- Shipped schema-validated runtime configuration, configuration validation tooling, and hardened middleware (CSP, correlation IDs, error handling) to close pre-update audit gaps.

## Community, Communication & Live Services Progress

- Activated the realtime platform with a socket.io server bound to the API lifecycle, Redis adapters for scaling, and presence registries that enforce per-user connection limits with audit trails.
- Delivered namespaces for community chat, voice rooms, live events, and moderation control, each with role/permission guards, Agora token minting, and broadcast workflows for join/leave/activity signals.
- Hardened the Jest test harness to prime realtime dependencies and added targeted unit tests covering channel access control and connection governance.
- Updated the realtime channel registry so company war-room access keys off role membership instead of hidden permission grants and documented the SKIP_SEQUELIZE_BOOTSTRAP test harness guard to keep targeted suites isolated from legacy model definitions.
