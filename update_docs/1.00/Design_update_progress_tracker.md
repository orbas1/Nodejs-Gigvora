# Version 1.00 Design Update â€“ Progress Tracker

| Metric | Score (0-100%) | Commentary |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| Design Quality Grade | 71% | Messaging, feed, profile, marketplace, and ads journeys now carry production-ready storyboards with offline, streaming, and recovery states, leaving wallet and volunteer visuals as the remaining gap. |
| Design Organisation Grade | 65% | Component inventories updated with chat/feed/ads modules and DI mapping, though provider analytics taxonomy still requires approval. |
| Design Position Grade | 58% | Engagement narrative strengthened with ads monetisation storyline; volunteer differentiators continue to need clearer proof points. |
| Design Text Grade | 62% | Offline/biometric disclosures and ads compliance copy delivered; marketing tone localisation still underway. |
| Design Colour Grade | 73% | Emo theme overlays validated against new chat/feed states; Studio Noir contrast testing outstanding. |
| Design Render Grade | 63% | High-fidelity renders cover profile, feed streaming, and 75% of critical states including offline and success variants; responsive breakpoints for wallet in progress. |
| Compliance Grade | 54% | Privacy notices for chat overlays and ads targeting approved; FCA finance copy for volunteer stipends pending. |
| Security Grade | 58% | Biometric escalation, session handoff, and offline queue risk messaging added; agency secure theming controls still untested. |
| Design Functionality Grade | 69% | Interaction specs cover optimistic updates, realtime feed reconnection, retry logic, and ads campaign publishing, with wallet failure flows queued. |
| Design Images Grade | 55% | New iconography for chat presence, offline badges, and ads pacing delivered; volunteer illustration backlog persists. |
| Design Usability Grade | 63% | Remote usability sessions validated chat overlay, feed composer clarity, and profile metric comprehension; ads budgeting clarity needs follow-up. |
| Bugs-Less Grade | 64% | Design bugs resolved for chat overlay stacking context and feed composer focus handling; remaining issues limited to volunteer flows. |
| Test Grade | 44% | Moderated usability now underway for chat/feed modules, but accessibility audits still pending scheduling. |
| QA Grade | 52% | QA checklist executed for chat/feed/ads journeys with annotated acceptance criteria; wallet and volunteer passes outstanding. |
| Design Accuracy Grade | 64% | Engineering sign-off received for chat/feed/ads specs with responsive annotations; provider analytics still lacks final breakpoints. |
| Overall Grade | 62% | Engagement suite designs now production-ready across major journeys, with profile parity and realtime feed cues locked; compliance sign-off and imagery completion remain key blockers to GA. |

## Immediate Priorities
1. Finalise FCA/GDPR reviews for ads budgeting and volunteer stipends to lift compliance scores above 70% before development lock-in.
2. Allocate illustration resources to finish Launchpad and Volunteer states, improving imagery and render grades.
3. Extend moderated usability tests to wallet budgeting and volunteer commitments; integrate findings into backlog.
4. Expand design QA execution to wallet and volunteer journeys to keep parity with engineering delivery.
