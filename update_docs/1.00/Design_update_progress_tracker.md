# Version 1.00 Design Update â€“ Progress Tracker

| Metric | Score (0-100%) | Commentary |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| Design Quality Grade | 63% | Core journeys upgraded to high fidelity with consistent component language, but Launchpad illustrations remain 30% incomplete. |
| Design Organisation Grade | 60% | Page templates and partial inventories documented; taxonomy for provider dashboards still under review with operations. |
| Design Position Grade | 55% | Brand positioning narratives drafted, yet competitive differentiators for Volunteers hub need refinement and proof points. |
| Design Text Grade | 58% | Copy decks cover booking, compliance, and support flows; tone adjustments for marketing campaigns pending localisation review. |
| Design Colour Grade | 65% | Token library approved in both light/dark themes plus Creator Pulse variant; Studio Noir theme requires additional contrast validation. |
| Design Render Grade | 52% | High-fidelity renders exist for 60% of states; motion and responsive breakpoints awaiting final polish. |
| Compliance Grade | 48% | Accessibility audit booked and compliance copy embedded, but FCA and GDPR legal statements still pending final counsel sign-off. |
| Security Grade | 50% | Security messaging for biometric login and device trust captured, while secure theming controls for agencies remain untested. |
| Design Functionality Grade | 57% | Interaction specs documented for navigation, booking, and messaging; wallet error states and offline flows not yet prototyped. |
| Design Images Grade | 49% | Asset library launched with compression guardrails; 35% of Experience Launchpad imagery requires new art direction. |
| Design Usability Grade | 54% | Initial usability tests show improved navigation comprehension, but onboarding success for agencies is below the 80% target. |
| Bugs-Less Grade | 62% | Known design defects tracked in Jira with owners; theming regression backlog moderate but manageable. |
| Test Grade | 38% | Formal usability and accessibility tests scheduled but not completed; only guerrilla testing data available. |
| QA Grade | 44% | Design QA checklist drafted; execution coverage across journeys is currently <40%. |
| Design Accuracy Grade | 59% | Figma specs largely aligned with engineering constraints; provider analytics modules require additional responsive annotations. |
| Overall Grade | 55% | Solid foundation in place with systemisation progress, yet compliance, imagery, and validation streams lag behind critical launch thresholds. |

## Immediate Priorities
1. Complete accessibility and legal reviews to lift compliance and security scores above 70% before development lock-in.
2. Allocate illustration resources to finish Launchpad and Volunteer states, improving imagery and render grades.
3. Execute moderated usability tests for agency onboarding and wallet flows; feed findings into iteration backlog.
4. Accelerate design QA execution by pairing designers with QA leads on component-by-component sign-offs.
