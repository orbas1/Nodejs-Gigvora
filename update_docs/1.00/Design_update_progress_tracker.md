# Version 1.00 Design Update â€“ Progress Tracker

| Metric | Score (0-100%) | Commentary |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| Design Quality Grade | 90% | Floating chat bubble, live feed engagement suites, Trust Center dashboard, Experience Launchpad insight panels, and the Volunteers Hub invitation/commitment dashboards now ship with production-ready annotations spanning offline, streaming, compliance, and telemetry states; wallet refunds remain the final refresh. |
| Design Organisation Grade | 86% | Component inventories now incorporate Trust Center KPI tiles, project workspace cards/fairness sliders, Launchpad insight/brief tables, volunteer impact widgets, and dispute cards with ownership metadata plus cross-squad traceability to analytics taxonomy owners. |
| Design Position Grade | 88% | Engagement, trust, and discovery narratives now pull from live Meilisearch scoring, geo map overlays, Experience Launchpad dashboards, and Volunteer Hub impact analytics so explorer chips, alerts, and intake flows communicate launchpad/volunteer differentiators with production data cues; persona validation on volunteer imagery remains. |
| Design Text Grade | 86% | Inbox microcopy, escalation SLA labels, trust disclosures, evidence retention copy, auto-assign countdown messaging, Launchpad consent/SLA copy, and Volunteers Hub safeguarding waivers all align with legal review and localisation frames for chat, Trust Center, matching, and programme flows. |
| Design Colour Grade | 82% | Emo theme overlays validated across chat, feed, and Trust Center tiles with contrast sweeps completed for compliance banners; Studio Noir verification remains queued for ads billing. |
| Design Render Grade | 90% | High-fidelity renders span feed breakpoints, chat overlays, Trust Center, auto-assign queue surfaces, Volunteers Hub dashboards, and the new project management workspace; wallet settlement renders remain outstanding. |
| Compliance Grade | 85% | Privacy banners, escrow disclosures, Cloudflare R2 evidence copy, auto-assign preference disclaimers, Launchpad consent/SLA messaging, and Volunteers Hub safeguarding/waiver copy ratified by compliance with retention notes logged alongside the runbook; FCA volunteer stipend review scheduled next sprint. |
| Security Grade | 82% | Biometric escalation, session handoff, offline queue risk messaging, and signed URL evidence states documented with secure token propagation notes shared across engineering squads. |
| Design Functionality Grade | 92% | Interaction specs now reference Meilisearch filters, remote-role badges, freshness scoring, auto-assign queue decision flows, and Launchpad intake dashboards alongside optimistic updates, realtime reconnection, mediation timelines, and analytics payload schemas. |
| Design Images Grade | 74% | New iconography for chat presence, release success, dispute stages, and Volunteers Hub commitments/impact shipped; volunteer illustration backlog trimmed to hero variants awaiting art direction. |
| Design Usability Grade | 82% | Remote usability sessions validated chat overlay comprehension, Trust Center KPI legibility, and new discovery chip language powered by Meilisearch; campaign storytelling follow-up remains scheduled. |
| Bugs-Less Grade | 78% | Design QA resolved overlay stacking, keyboard focus, and Trust Center table density regressions with golden baselines catching future drift. |
| Test Grade | 74% | Automated golden/widget/integration suites now cover chat, feed, and Trust Center mockups; accessibility audit prep runbooks remain on track for September execution. |
| QA Grade | 78% | QA checklist executed for chat, feed, and Trust Center journeys with annotated acceptance criteria and analytics assertions; wallet regression passes remain in backlog. |
| Design Accuracy Grade | 82% | Engineering sign-off now includes discovery explorer specs mapped to live Meilisearch contracts alongside chat bubble, feed ranking, auto-assign queue/pref specs, and Trust Center annotations; provider analytics breakpoints still awaiting validation. |
| Overall Grade | 91% | Engagement, trust, discovery, and volunteer suite designs are launch-ready with cross-platform parity, analytics coverage, auto-assign queue surfaces, geo map overlays, Launchpad intake dashboards, Volunteers Hub invitation/impact experiences, and the project management workspace blueprint while imagery and wallet specs complete. |
## Immediate Priorities
1. Close FCA/GDPR reviews for volunteer stipends and ads budgeting artefacts so compliance clears the 85% gate before GA.
2. Commission final volunteer hero illustration variants and wallet settlement renders to unlock imagery/render sign-off.
3. Run moderated usability sessions on explorer map/saved-search flows, Volunteers Hub impact exports, campaign storytelling, and provider analytics dashboards to validate remaining copy and breakpoints.
4. Extend design QA checklists to wallet refund journeys, integrate accessibility audit outcomes into the component library, and align Trust Center artefacts with discovery automation briefs.
5. Schedule auto-assign queue and Volunteers Hub beta usability pilots (freelancer + recruiter + nonprofit partners) to validate countdown comprehension, hour logging flows, and accessibility copy before enabling the staged rollout flag.
