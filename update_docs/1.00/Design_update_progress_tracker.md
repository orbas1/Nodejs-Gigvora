# Version 1.00 Design Update â€“ Progress Tracker

| Metric | Score (0-100%) | Commentary |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| Design Quality Grade | 71% | Messaging, feed, profile, marketplace, and ads journeys now carry production-ready storyboards with offline, streaming, and recovery states, leaving wallet and volunteer visuals as the remaining gap. |
| Design Organisation Grade | 68% | Component inventories now reference CI/CD guardrails and shared analytics taxonomy; provider analytics taxonomy still requires approval. |
| Design Position Grade | 58% | Engagement narrative strengthened with ads monetisation storyline; volunteer differentiators continue to need clearer proof points. |
| Design Text Grade | 62% | Offline/biometric disclosures and ads compliance copy delivered; marketing tone localisation still underway. |
| Design Colour Grade | 73% | Emo theme overlays validated against new chat/feed states; Studio Noir contrast testing outstanding. |
| Design Render Grade | 63% | High-fidelity renders cover profile, feed streaming, and 75% of critical states including offline and success variants; responsive breakpoints for wallet in progress. |
| Compliance Grade | 54% | Privacy notices for chat overlays and ads targeting approved; FCA finance copy for volunteer stipends pending. |
| Security Grade | 70% | Biometric escalation, session handoff, and offline queue risk messaging now pair with secure token propagation plus CI-enforced telemetry dashboards; agency secure theming controls still untested. |
| Design Functionality Grade | 71% | Interaction specs cover optimistic updates, realtime feed reconnection, retry logic, ads campaign publishing, and now capture CI-driven rollback gates; wallet failure flows remain queued. |
| Design Images Grade | 55% | New iconography for chat presence, offline badges, and ads pacing delivered; volunteer illustration backlog persists. |
| Design Usability Grade | 64% | Remote usability sessions validated chat overlay, feed composer clarity, and profile metric comprehension; CI smoke test telemetry now feeds research dashboards, while ads budgeting clarity still needs follow-up. |
| Bugs-Less Grade | 66% | Design bugs resolved for chat overlay stacking context and feed composer focus handling; CI golden baselines now flag regressions early, with remaining issues limited to volunteer flows. |
| Test Grade | 62% | Automated golden, widget, and integration suites now run in CI alongside moderated usability; accessibility audits remain pending scheduling. |
| QA Grade | 64% | QA checklist executed for chat/feed/ads journeys with annotated acceptance criteria, and CI gates now enforce the checklist across builds; wallet and volunteer passes remain outstanding. |
| Design Accuracy Grade | 64% | Engineering sign-off received for chat/feed/ads specs with responsive annotations; provider analytics still lacks final breakpoints. |
| Overall Grade | 66% | Engagement suite designs remain production-ready with CI/CD guarding visual fidelity and telemetry-backed dashboards; compliance sign-off and imagery completion remain key blockers to GA. |

## Immediate Priorities
1. Finalise FCA/GDPR reviews for ads budgeting and volunteer stipends to lift compliance scores above 70% before development lock-in.
2. Allocate illustration resources to finish Launchpad and Volunteer states, improving imagery and render grades.
3. Extend moderated usability tests to wallet budgeting and volunteer commitments; integrate findings into backlog.
4. Expand design QA execution to wallet and volunteer journeys to keep parity with engineering delivery.
