# Issue Report — Version 1.00 Pre-Update Evaluations

## Overview
End-to-end evaluations spanning backend services, databases, dependency governance, the React front-end, and the Flutter user application reveal a release candidate that is feature-rich but operationally fragile. Each surface area duplicates bootstrap logic, relies on unauthenticated health signals, and consumes configuration directly from environment variables without validation. Security controls lag behind stated compliance goals, observability is fragmented across worker pools, and cross-platform contracts drift from shared expectations. Without coordinated remediation, Version 1.00 cannot meet availability, security, or governance objectives.

## Backend Platform
### Startup, Routing, and Worker Stability
The HTTP bootstrap path launches database warm-up, dependency guard hydration, and background worker activation multiple times, so queues and schedulers can double-spawn or fail silently while readiness probes still pass. When background workers fail to start, orchestration catches the rejection, drops stack traces, and bubbles up a generic error string, depriving automation of the cues it needs to distinguish queue credentials from scheduler overlap. Startup continues even when dependency hydration rejects and never unwinds partially warmed caches, and shutdown emits audit events before draining database pools, masking partial failures. Router bundles redeclare modules (for example, `creationStudioRoutes`), mount identical routers under multiple prefixes, and keep every domain bundled into a single `index.js`, so syntax errors surface at import time, API behaviour drifts across aliases, and service decomposition remains blocked. Health endpoints expose `/health`, `/health/ready`, and `/health/metrics` with nearly identical payloads yet no dependency pagination or queue status, while the runtime dependency guard watches conflicting feature flags that flip cache states unpredictably.

### Configuration, Observability, and Error Hygiene
Operational configuration is pulled directly from raw environment variables without schema validation, defaults, or onboarding tooling. Payload caps, rate limits, and CORS behaviour live in environment variables with no runtime inspection endpoints, platform settings require restarts instead of runtime reloads, and there is no operator console or CLI for validating settings before they hit production. Logging remains anchored to a single `pino-http` instance on Express requests while background workers fall back to `console`, correlation IDs trust arbitrary `x-request-id` headers, and perimeter metrics accumulate unbounded state in memory. Startup failure handling shuts down database connections but leaves partially warmed dependency guard caches running, global error handlers echo `err.details` back to clients, and CORS responses omit remediation guidance, forcing operators to sift through logs for root causes.

### Security Exposure and Governance Drift
Security posture is inconsistent with roadmap expectations: Helmet retains `'unsafe-inline'` directives, `/health/metrics` streams Prometheus counters without authentication, and the web application firewall dynamically imports audit helpers on the hot path, risking event-loop stalls during attacks. Database credentials, SSL options, and worker configuration inherit unchecked environment variables, correlation IDs accept spoofed headers, and background worker tracking stores stop callbacks in in-memory maps suited only for single-instance deployments. Core migrations still persist plaintext passwords, runtime dependency guards never throw the imported `ServiceUnavailableError`, and optional enterprise integrations land without licensing or rollout controls, undermining the platform governance story.

### Alignment and Architectural Notes
The backend aspires to modular domain isolation yet continues to ship a monolithic router that spans creation studio, freelancer, and operations domains. There is no API versioning or deprecation guidance, health snapshots omit queue saturation, and observability hooks lack corresponding runbooks. Console fallbacks remain throughout dependency sync helpers, and perimeter metrics helpers increment in-memory maps without eviction, signalling unfinished scalability work compared with multi-region ambitions.

## Database Layer
### Schema Integrity and Operational Safety
Core migrations omit unique constraints, indexes, foreign key update rules, and transaction wrappers, inviting duplicate personas per user, stale two-factor tokens, and rounding surprises from unconstrained `DECIMAL` fields. Supporting indexes on `email`, `userId`, and foreign keys are missing entirely, so lookups will degrade long before sharding becomes a viable escape hatch. Later migrations expect Postgres JSONB semantics even though production targets MySQL, leading to unindexed blob storage when the dialect falls back. Community and platform modules provision expansive transactional tables without paired reporting projections, ensuring analytics traffic will stress production schemas. Foreign keys lack `ON UPDATE` clauses, persona tables lack uniqueness, and OTP tables never expire records, compounding data integrity risks.

### Migration Reliability and Environment Drift
Migration batches run outside explicit transactions, failures leave half-created tables, and database lifecycle hooks mark pools as “degraded” even after graceful shutdowns. Bootstrap scripts never validate charset, collation, SSL enforcement, or pool sizing, so typographical errors produce `NaN` pools or downgrade security silently. SQLite remains the default for automated tests yet leaves residue files that cloud QA isolation, and there is no seeded data or schema snapshot for onboarding or mobile cache validation. Warm-up flows do not coordinate database connections with background worker pools, risking contention during startup, and runtime health metrics omit transaction isolation, replication role, and pool saturation details needed for orchestration decisions.

### Security and Compliance Gaps
Passwords, two-factor secrets, and credential columns remain plaintext, SSL toggles flip to `rejectUnauthorized: false`, and there is no guidance for encryption at rest despite handling PII-heavy tables. Configuration lacks a production profile in `sequelize.config.cjs`, secrets live directly in environment variables, and there is no automated backup/restore or audit trail to meet resilience requirements. Session and schema alignment with mobile clients is absent, so Hive caches cannot validate server models, and runtime dependency guards never surface structured errors that clients can act upon. SQLite remains the automated test default, concealing MySQL-specific behaviours during QA runs and widening the gap between environments.

### Governance and Lifecycle Management
Migration naming spans auto-assign, trust, discovery, and launchpad domains without a unifying charter, signalling schema sprawl that will be difficult to steward as more product surfaces land. There is still no seeded data set or sandbox orchestration to help new engineers understand relational boundaries, and QA pipelines rely on SQLite snapshots even though production locks to MySQL. Without governance over which team owns each migration series or how domain tables map to reporting projections, the database layer will continue to drift faster than downstream consumers can adapt.

## Dependency Governance
### Manifest Drift and Build Instability
Dependency manifests exhibit unchecked drift: the web client declares incompatible `date-fns` majors, backend packages retain `node-fetch`, `morgan`, and CommonJS-only utilities like `fs-extra`, and Flutter modules mix GraphQL, REST, Hive caches, and design system packages without feature-flag modularisation. Relative path dependencies force full monorepo clones, Node and React projects run outside a workspace so upgrades cannot be orchestrated centrally, and heavy SDKs such as Mapbox, Agora, AWS, and Meilisearch ship without rollout gating. Optional integrations import packages without guards, package versions rely on caret ranges while lockfiles are checked in, confusing upgrade semantics, and Flutter workspaces omit `pubspec.lock`, preventing reproducible builds.

### Integration, Tooling, and Documentation Debt
React bundles `axios` while the API client sticks with `fetch`, shared contracts ship as static JSON snapshots with no generation pipeline, and backend schema sync scripts depend on tooling absent from the frontend. Membership headers diverge between clients, dependency guard flags conflict across services, and Vite dev server defaults collide with npm overrides. Flutter path dependencies break `pub get` when the design system is unavailable, offline caches require manual `init()` calls with no enforcement, riverpod providers default to production services, and platform-specific configuration for dependencies like `permission_handler` and `google_sign_in` is undocumented. Supply-chain governance suffers further because there is no workspace automation to drive upgrades across packages or to enforce contract regeneration when schemas move.

### Security and Licensing Concerns
Tokens remain in `localStorage` and unencrypted Hive stores despite available secure storage libraries, DOMPurify is imported inline rather than through a hardened helper, and high-risk SDKs arrive without licensing reviews or consent gating. Optional enterprise integrations lack feature flags, and there is no workspace tooling to coordinate dependency audits across packages, leaving supply-chain risk management fragmented.

## Front-end Application
### Routing, State, and Navigation Debt
`App.jsx` maintains sprawling arrays of route metadata alongside explicit JSX declarations, so dashboards register twice, become unreachable when definitions drift, and leak privileged module names to unauthorised users. Role guards compare raw membership strings without normalisation, there is no catch-all 404, and fallback routing sends unauthorised users to membership-specific pages rather than safe defaults. Dev server defaults collide (Vite 5173 vs npm 4173), Storybook or UI documentation is absent, and bundle configuration lacks code-splitting directives, forcing initial loads to include every dashboard, Agora, and Mapbox even for first-time visitors.

### API, Session, and Error Handling Gaps
The SPA targets `http://localhost:4000/api` while the backend defaults to 5000, strips `Content-Type` headers from multipart requests, assumes JSON for every response, and collapses backend errors into generic “Request failed” messages. Session persistence relies on custom `localStorage` serializers that swallow parse errors, concurrent use of cookies and `Authorization` headers duplicates authentication state, and cached membership headers drift from backend-issued scopes. Base URL discovery offers no runtime feedback, leaving end users with blank screens when configuration is missing, and admin routes remain exposed even though backend RBAC is absent.

### Security and Compliance Risks
Access and refresh tokens live in `localStorage`, custom headers derive from client-controlled state, and membership gates render privileged components before guards resolve, leaking taxonomy via bundled code. DOMPurify usage is local to specific pages rather than a hardened utility, CSP retains `'unsafe-inline'`, and route metadata surfaces internal labels to unauthorised users. Lack of coordinated sanitisation, secure session handling, and capability toggles leaves the front-end out of sync with backend security expectations.

## User Mobile Application
### Bootstrap Reliability and State Persistence
The Flutter app chains heavy `FutureProvider`s serially, watches them from the root widget on every rebuild, and clears tokens whenever refresh attempts fail—even during transient outages. Service locator singletons initialise once and crash on hot restart, default providers throw when overrides are missing, and offline caches require manual `init()` that the bootstrap never awaits. Analytics flushes erase queued events during hot reloads, theme loading hardcodes a single palette with no fallback, snackbars queue without deduplication, and membership headers emit raw `X-Gigvora-*` strings without localisation or guidance.

### Error Handling, Integration, and Testability
Theme bootstrap failures only log to `debugPrint`, `AuthTokenStore` swallows storage errors, session bootstrappers return success when runtime health calls fail, and runtime health queries fire unauthenticated before cached tokens are loaded, doubling initial network calls. Push notifications, analytics, and feature flags initialise without readiness signals, service locator wiring prevents feature modules from injecting doubles, and riverpod defaults risk hitting live infrastructure during automated tests. Membership headers diverge from the web format, complicating middleware, there is no schema snapshot for mobile caches to verify alignment with server models, and platform-level maintenance notices never flow through the app because the bootstrap ignores the central settings service.

### Security and Governance Concerns
Tokens persist in unencrypted Hive boxes, runtime health signals trust unauthenticated responses, analytics and push initialisation omit certificate pinning, and copied tokens remain valid across devices until expiry. Feature flags, analytics, and push remain mandatory at launch with no configuration toggles, contradicting staged rollout strategies, and provider scaffolding assumes every feature is core even when roadmap documents suggest modular deployments.

## Cross-Cutting Misalignment
Ports (4000 vs 5000 vs 5173), header names, and dependency guard toggles conflict across services, preventing consistent environment setup. Shared contracts remain static JSON snapshots with no generation or validation tooling, optional enterprise integrations lack licensing, consent, and security governance, and documentation for lifecycle scripts or incident response is absent. Without a platform-wide configuration charter, workspace automation to coordinate dependency upgrades, and a documented schema-alignment process between MySQL and Hive caches, individual fixes will drift again before Version 1.00 can ship reliably.
