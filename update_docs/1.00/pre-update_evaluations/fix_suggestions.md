# Fix Suggestions — Version 1.00 Pre-Update Evaluations

## Backend Hardening
1. Rebuild the HTTP bootstrap into a single-state lifecycle that initialises database pools, dependency guard caches, and background workers exactly once, fails fast on warm-up errors, surfaces stack traces and machine-actionable error codes to the orchestrator, and unwinds partially started services before exiting.
2. Refactor router composition into discrete domain modules with linting that blocks duplicate imports, add API versioning headers, and consolidate mounting logic so each resource is exposed under a single canonical path.
3. Redesign health reporting so `/health` acts as a minimal liveness probe, `/health/ready` streams paginated dependency and worker status, and `/health/metrics` is gated behind authentication with cache-busting disabled; fold queue depth, job failures, and dependency guard state into the readiness payload.
4. Replace ad-hoc environment reads with schema-validated configuration (e.g., `zod`, `envsafe`) that enforces defaults, documents payload/rate limits, validates ports and SSL settings, and exposes a runtime inspection endpoint, operator console, and hot-reload hook for platform settings.
5. Promote `pino` to a shared transport for HTTP and workers, generate server-side correlation IDs instead of trusting `x-request-id`, strip `'unsafe-inline'` from the CSP, and pre-load WAF audit helpers while bounding perimeter metric caches to avoid unbounded growth.
6. Align lifecycle shutdown to drain database pools before logging audit events, coordinate worker stop callbacks across instances, and emit structured `ServiceUnavailableError` responses when dependency guard checks fail so automation can distinguish transient outages.
7. Publish operator runbooks and automated checks for observability hooks, enforce consistent port defaults across services, and supply `.env.example` files plus CI validation to prevent local configuration drift.

## Database Governance
8. Retrofit migrations with explicit transactions, hashed credential columns (including two-factor secrets), unique indexes, foreign key `ON UPDATE/DELETE` clauses, OTP expirations, and MySQL-friendly JSON alternatives; backfill existing tables where possible.
9. Add migration orchestration that coordinates database warm-up with worker pools, validates charset/collation/SSL before boot, and aborts startup when pool sizing or credentials fail schema validation.
10. Introduce seed data, schema snapshots, and checksum exports for onboarding, regression tests, and mobile cache validation; wire these artefacts into CI to detect drift early.
11. Extend health metrics to include pool saturation, replication role, and transaction isolation; ensure lifecycle monitors clear degraded flags after successful shutdown and align automated tests with the production MySQL dialect.
12. Add a production profile to `sequelize.config.cjs`, externalise secrets to dedicated stores, enforce encryption-at-rest guardrails, and automate backup/restore procedures aligned with resilience targets.

## Dependency Management and Tooling
13. Normalise manifests by removing duplicate libraries (`date-fns`, `node-fetch`, `morgan`, `fs-extra`), adopting modern equivalents, and introducing workspace tooling (npm workspaces or pnpm) alongside `melos` to coordinate upgrades.
14. Commit lockfiles for all packages (including Flutter), document upgrade workflows, and add CI gates that block releases when lockfiles and manifests diverge.
15. Guard optional imports with feature-detection wrappers, introduce lint rules banning path-based design system dependencies, and ship feature flags plus consent/licensing reviews for heavy SDKs and enterprise integrations.
16. Provide a central sanitisation helper for DOMPurify usage, unify membership headers across clients, standardise dependency guard toggles, and publish a shared configuration module for ports, base URLs, and authentication headers.
17. Build a contract generation pipeline out of the `shared-contracts` workspace that emits typed SDKs for React and Flutter consumers, replacing static JSON snapshots and preventing drift.
18. Document platform-specific setup for mobile dependencies (`permission_handler`, `google_sign_in`) and add preflight scripts that verify required entitlements, SHA hashes, and plist updates before builds run.
19. Update Flutter packages to enforce `init()` at construction time (or automatically during provider bootstrap), add secure storage adapters, and provide mockable service locators for tests to avoid live infrastructure calls.

## Front-end Remediation
20. Collapse duplicated routing structures into a single metadata source, generate `<Route>` trees dynamically, add a catch-all 404, implement safe fallback destinations, and delay rendering of privileged modules until guard checks resolve.
21. Rebuild the API client to auto-discover base URLs, preserve `Content-Type` for multipart and binary payloads, support streaming, and surface structured error details for diagnostics while unifying on a single HTTP stack (either `fetch` with helpers or `axios`).
22. Replace bespoke `localStorage` session handling with a hardened state manager that supports secure cookies or memory-only tokens, normalises membership casing, and rotates credentials without exposing secrets to XSS.
23. Introduce route-level code splitting (React.lazy/Suspense) and feature flags for heavy SDKs, and add Storybook or equivalent documentation so designers and QA can inspect shared components without booting the full app.
24. Provide runtime configuration feedback in the UI (or onboarding guides) when API endpoints are unreachable, ensuring support teams can diagnose misconfigured environments quickly.

## Mobile (User App) Stabilisation
25. Redesign bootstrap to parallelise async initialisers, await cache `init()` before rendering, memoise providers to avoid reruns on rebuild, and gate analytics flushes behind explicit lifecycle events.
26. Harden state persistence by encrypting Hive boxes (or migrating to secure storage), surfacing storage errors, distinguishing transient refresh failures from true expiry, and preventing automatic token wipes when the backend is unreachable.
27. Introduce readiness signals and retry surfaces for analytics, push, feature flags, and runtime health; require authenticated health checks and cache tokens before performing unauthenticated probes.
28. Refactor the service locator to support teardown and reinitialisation, provide dependency injection hooks for tests, supply safe defaults instead of throwing when overrides are missing, and allow feature modules to register opt-in capabilities without touching global state.
29. Add user-facing error handling for theme/bootstrap failures, expose theme switching or fallback palettes, and deduplicate snackbar notifications to avoid overwhelming users.
30. Ship configuration toggles for optional integrations, align membership header formats with the web client, document modular rollout paths for partner-specific experiences, and surface platform settings service maintenance notices within the mobile UI.

## Cross-Cutting Coordination
31. Establish a platform configuration charter that codifies port assignments, header names, dependency guard flags, and environment variable schemas across backend, web, and mobile services.
32. Create governance for enterprise integrations covering licensing reviews, consent gating, vendor security assessments, and feature flag rollout plans before SDKs land in production builds.
33. Publish shared runbooks, lifecycle documentation, and incident response guides that align observability hooks with operational expectations and ensure teams know how to support the hardened platform.
34. Expand automated testing and CI scaffolding to supply mocks for external services, prevent riverpod defaults from hitting live infrastructure, and verify that optional dependencies remain guarded in every build variant.
35. Establish a MySQL–Hive schema alignment workflow (snapshots, code generation, contract publishing) tied to workspace automation so backend changes regenerate typed SDKs and mobile caches before release.
