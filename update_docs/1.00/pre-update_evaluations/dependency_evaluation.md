# Dependency Evaluation â€“ Version 1.00

## Functionality
- Backend and front-end dependencies cover the essentials (Express/Sequelize, React/Vite, Flutter core packages) but there is no shared contract layer or schema validation library, leaving request/response structures untyped and brittle.
- Several third-party integrations promised in product positioning (email, analytics, payments) are missing entirely from dependencies, signalling incomplete functionality relative to roadmap.

## Usability
- The backend and frontend rely on manual `npm install` without specifying Node.js versions. Adding an `.nvmrc` or engines field would prevent mismatches when contributors use Node 18 vs 20.
- There is no package manager consistency: backend omits a lockfile, while the frontend includes `package-lock.json`. This will cause divergent dependency trees across environments.

## Errors & Stability
- Sequelize, mysql2, and bcrypt are pinned with caret ranges. Without a lockfile this allows silent minor upgrades that could introduce breaking changes (e.g., MySQL protocol adjustments) and makes reproducing bugs difficult.
- Security patches rely on manual updates; there is no Dependabot/renovate configuration to monitor CVEs. Known vulnerabilities in transitive dependencies could linger unnoticed.

## Integration
- No shared configuration exists for environment variables across services. Each application pulls directly from `process.env` or Flutter `.env` equivalents, raising the risk of inconsistent naming and values when integrating backend, web, and mobile builds.
- API clients (axios on web, http in Flutter) are imported directly without central wrappers for auth headers or retries, complicating future integration with token refresh workflows.

## Security
- Helmet is included on the backend but there is no complementary dependency for rate limiting (e.g., `express-rate-limit`) or input sanitization. The dependency set does not mitigate OWASP Top 10 vectors by default.
- Frontend lacks runtime dependency scanning (no `npm audit` script, no SAST tooling). Flutter project similarly omits `flutter pub outdated` or security guidance, reducing visibility into vulnerable packages.

## Alignment
- Dependency choices align with an MVP stack but fall short of enterprise expectations. Missing telemetry (e.g., Winston/Datadog), testing libraries (Jest, React Testing Library), and tooling for CI/CD shows the dependency graph has not been curated to match the platform ambitions described in documentation.
