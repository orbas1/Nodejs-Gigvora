# User App (Flutter) Evaluation â€“ Version 1.00

## Functionality
- Navigation scaffolding exists with GoRouter, but feature screens are placeholders with static content. There is no data fetching, authentication flow, or integration with backend endpoints.
- Critical mobile capabilities such as push notifications, offline caching, and profile editing are absent. The app cannot yet support a production user journey.

## Usability
- UI theming leverages Google Fonts and Material 3, yet there is minimal attention to platform-specific conventions (no adaptive layouts, limited use of Cupertino widgets for iOS parity).
- Accessibility is unaddressed: semantic labels, screen reader support, and high-contrast modes are missing, risking exclusion for assistive technology users.

## Errors & Stability
- There is no error boundary or global exception handling via `FlutterError.onError`, so runtime issues will crash the app without telemetry.
- HTTP layer is not abstracted; without interceptors or retry logic the app will fail silently when backend requests error or time out.

## Integration
- State management is scaffolded with Riverpod but providers are not implemented. There are no repositories or data sources wired up, so integrating backend services will require significant groundwork.
- Environment configuration (API base URLs, feature flags) is absent. Builds cannot easily target staging/production environments or enable A/B experiments.

## Security
- Authentication storage strategy is undefined. There is no secure storage integration (e.g., flutter_secure_storage) for JWTs or 2FA tokens.
- Input validation and sanitization are not implemented, leaving forms vulnerable once connected to live services.

## Alignment
- The mobile app mirrors the route map of the web platform, showing alignment in vision, but the implementation remains a prototype. Feature parity and performance requirements for public release are unmet.
- Lack of analytics, crash reporting, and QA automation (integration tests, golden tests) indicates the app is not aligned with production-readiness standards demanded by stakeholders.
