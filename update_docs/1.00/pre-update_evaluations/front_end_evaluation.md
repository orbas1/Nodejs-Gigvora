# Front-end Evaluation – Version 1.00

## Functionality
- The React app covers primary navigation (home, feed, marketplace pages) but most screens render static placeholder data. There is no integration with backend APIs for feed posts, search results, or authentication.
- Forms such as register/login submit using axios but do not handle loading states, validation errors, or success flows, leaving critical journeys incomplete.

## Usability
- UI relies heavily on Tailwind utility classes and components but lacks responsive testing—several sections (e.g., `FeatureGrid`, `OpportunitySections`) assume large screen layouts and overflow on smaller viewports.
- There is no localization or accessibility strategy (missing ARIA attributes, skip links, keyboard focus management), which will block compliance efforts.
- Navigation is defined manually in components without route guards. Users can access authenticated routes like `/feed` even when not logged in, resulting in confusing experiences.

## Errors & Stability
- Error handling is minimal; axios calls do not catch exceptions, and components do not render fallback UI. A failed API request will throw to the console and leave the page blank.
- There is no unit or integration test coverage. The project ships without Jest/RTL, storybook, or visual regression tooling, making UI regressions likely.

## Integration
- API base URLs are hard-coded or absent. There is no environment-based configuration (e.g., Vite env variables) to differentiate staging vs production endpoints.
- State management is purely local React state; there is no global store or caching (React Query, Redux). Integrating with real-time updates or syncing with the mobile app will be difficult.

## Security
- Authentication tokens, once obtained, are not persisted or protected. There is no handling for refresh tokens or secure storage, leaving the app unable to maintain sessions.
- Input fields do not sanitize or constrain user input. Without validation, XSS vectors could arise when displaying user-generated content (e.g., feed posts) once connected to the backend.

## Alignment
- Visual design aligns with marketing messaging but functional depth falls short of a LinkedIn-style experience. Missing personalization, notifications, and collaboration features highlight the MVP status.
- Absence of analytics, error reporting, and feature flag tooling indicates the front-end is not yet aligned with growth/experimentation goals stated by stakeholders.
