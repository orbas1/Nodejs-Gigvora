# Backend Evaluation – Version 1.00

## Functionality
- Core authentication flows (register, login, 2FA verification) are implemented but lack validation of required fields and duplicate accounts. `authService.register` trusts the request payload and will happily insert malformed data (e.g., missing names, weak passwords) and does not surface meaningful errors to the client.
- Marketplace endpoints referenced in the README (feed, search, profiles) exist in the routing layer, yet many controllers are thin wrappers with minimal business logic. There is no pagination, filtering, or input sanitation on feed creation or search, which will cause scalability and relevancy gaps as data grows.
- Email delivery for 2FA is stubbed with a console log in `twoFactorService.sendToken`, preventing end-to-end login outside of development and leaving the authentication flow functionally incomplete.

## Usability
- Developer onboarding is partially documented, but environment configuration requires manual migration/seed commands and the README omits instructions for seeding admin users or obtaining JWT secrets, slowing new contributors.
- Error responses are inconsistent. Controllers simply `throw` and allow Express’ default error handler to respond, which means consumers receive generic stack traces during development and HTML error pages in production instead of a uniform JSON envelope.
- The service lacks OpenAPI/Swagger documentation or Postman collections, making it harder for front-end/mobile developers to discover request/response shapes.

## Errors & Stability
- There is no global error middleware; unhandled promise rejections bubble up to Express’ default handler. Any rejection inside Sequelize transactions (e.g., duplicate email) will produce a 500 instead of a structured 4xx.
- Transactions in `authService.register` only wrap user creation but not subsequent profile creation for companies/agencies, creating the risk of orphaned users if `CompanyProfile.create` fails.
- Logging is limited to Morgan access logs; there is no structured error logging or alerting, reducing observability when failures occur in production.

## Integration
- The backend assumes MySQL is provisioned but provides no Docker Compose or migration automation, impeding integration with CI/CD and local developer environments.
- There are no CORS origin restrictions beyond the default middleware configuration, so any front-end origin can call the API—useful for development but risky once web and mobile clients ship.
- There is no integration with email providers, storage, or queue systems despite TODO comments. External service boundaries are not abstracted, complicating future integrations.

## Security
- Password policy and strength validation are absent; weak credentials can be stored. Rate limiting and brute-force protections are missing on login and 2FA endpoints.
- JWT secrets are required but not validated at startup; if they are undefined the service will throw at runtime during the first login, rather than failing fast.
- 2FA codes are stored in plain text without hashing, and `TwoFactorToken` never expires records via cleanup job, leaving reusable codes in the database.

## Alignment
- The codebase roughly aligns with the stated goal of powering a LinkedIn-style marketplace, but lacks several essential safeguards (validation, pagination, production-ready 2FA) to support real users.
- Missing admin provisioning, analytics hooks, and notification integrations indicate the implementation is at MVP level rather than production-ready, so expectations with stakeholders should be adjusted accordingly.
