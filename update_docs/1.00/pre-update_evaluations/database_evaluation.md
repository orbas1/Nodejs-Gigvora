# Database Evaluation â€“ Version 1.00

## Functionality
- Core entities (users, profiles, marketplace tables) exist, but there is no linkage between jobs/gigs/projects and owners, so content cannot be attributed to companies or users.
- The schema lacks support for advanced features promised (recommendations, analytics, messaging). Without tables for comments, reactions, or applications the marketplace experience is skeletal.

## Usability
- Migrations are written in Sequelize CLI format but there is no seed data for critical reference tables (skills, industries). Developers cannot easily populate realistic datasets for testing search relevance.
- There is no documentation describing entity relationships or ER diagrams. Engineers must read migrations/models to understand how to query data, slowing iteration.

## Errors & Stability
- Many columns are nullable without validation (e.g., profile headline, companyName). This will lead to partially populated records and inconsistent UI behavior.
- ENUM columns (`userType`, connection status) are defined in migrations but not synchronized with model-level validations. Adding a new type requires manual updates in multiple files and risks runtime mismatches.

## Integration
- Foreign keys are defined but there are no composite indexes on high-volume lookup paths (e.g., `connections` by `requesterId`, `feed_posts` by `userId`). Query performance will degrade quickly as data grows.
- Two-factor tokens have no `createdAt` timestamps or cleanup strategy. Without TTL enforcement, the table will accumulate expired rows and complicate analytics.

## Security
- Sensitive data such as two-factor codes are stored unhashed. Additionally, there is no audit trail (no `lastLogin`, `passwordUpdatedAt`) to support security monitoring.
- There is no role/permission table. Admin privileges rely solely on the `userType` enum, providing no granular control or history.

## Alignment
- The schema partially aligns with a professional network but omits collaboration primitives (messages, endorsements, portfolios). Current design supports only a basic feed and static marketplace listings.
- Lack of migration versioning strategy (no roll-forward scripts, no documentation on seeding) signals the data layer is still in prototype phase and not ready for production rollout.
