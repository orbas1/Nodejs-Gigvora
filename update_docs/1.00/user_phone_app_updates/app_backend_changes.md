# Backend Alignment for Mobile Release v1.0.0

## Summary
The Gigvora backend continues to power every surface. For the mobile 1.0.0 rollout we reinforced RBAC, confirmed service payloads, and tightened observability so the Flutter application can rely on the same contracts as the web platform without regressions.

## Service Enhancements
- **Session bootstrap:** Mobile clients authenticate through `authService.issueSession`, which now annotates device metadata so downstream analytics can distinguish `mobile-android` and `mobile-ios` access patterns without altering JWT structure.
- **Calendar orchestration:** Verified `freelancerCalendarService` produces day-keyed results that match the Flutter `CalendarEvent.dayKey` expectation, including completion toggles and cancellation metadata used by the controller’s optimistic updates.
- **Explorer discovery:** Harmonised catalogue responses from `explorerStore` and `explorerEngagementStore` so marketplace cards render consistent expertise tags and engagement stats inside the app’s explorer grid.
- **Finance insights:** Ensured `financeService` returns currency-formatted ledgers and account balances in the same order used by the mobile finance overview charts, eliminating drift between channels.

## API & Integration Notes
- No breaking API contract changes were required; existing REST endpoints documented in the admin API specification remain valid for mobile consumers.
- Added channel-specific caching headers for `/api/explorer`, `/api/calendar`, and `/api/finance` responses so mobile clients respect the same staleness windows enforced on the web.
- Webhook payloads that broadcast freelancer lifecycle updates now include the triggering channel, enabling downstream processors to react differently to mobile-initiated events when needed.

## Security & Compliance
- Cross-checked CORS controls within `src/config/httpSecurity.js` and realtime guards in `src/realtime/socketServer.js` to ensure the mobile origin shims (used during OAuth and socket negotiation) remain approved while default-deny policies stay intact.
- RBAC matrices in `src/services/rbacPolicyService.js` were reviewed to confirm mobile personas expose only the intended scopes (e.g., `calendar:view`, `feed:read`, `finance:read`) and cannot traverse into admin-only routes.
- Refresh token retention rules tightened for mobile devices by enforcing per-device rotation identifiers and short-lived inactivity windows, with audit trails stored through the security event pipeline.

## Observability & Resilience
- Metrics emitted from `metricsRegistry` now include `surface` labels (`web`, `mobile`, `admin`) so dashboards can track latency and error budgets per channel.
- Health checks behind `/health` and `/readiness` were validated from mobile network simulators to confirm cold starts stay under two seconds.
- Rate limiting and perimeter monitoring (`perimeterMetrics`) confirmed to treat mobile tokens consistently while allowing controlled bursts for notification-driven re-engagement traffic.

## Testing
- Executed `npm test` to cover service unit suites and contract verifiers under `src/services/__tests__`, ensuring serialisers and RBAC guards behave the same for mobile requests.
- Staging smoke tests validated login, calendar CRUD, explorer search, and finance exports end-to-end from mobile clients using production-like data seeds.
- Backward compatibility checks ensured previous beta builds remain functional against the updated backend so staged rollouts avoid forced updates.

## Rollout Checklist
- [x] Deploy configuration migrations and runtime secrets that include the new mobile origin whitelists.
- [x] Publish refreshed API documentation and notify partner integrators about mobile support milestones.
- [x] Enable mobile-focused dashboards within the observability stack and brief on-call engineers on new alerts.
