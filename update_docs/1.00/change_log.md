# Version 1.10 Update Change Log

- Removed all provider phone app artifacts (documentation, evaluations, tests, and UI assets) from the update package to reflect the retirement of the provider mobile experience.
- Established Flutter monorepo structure with shared foundation/design-system packages, GetIt-driven dependency injection, and a production-ready blue design token loader powering the mobile theme.
- Activated offline-first chat, feed, marketplace, and ads modules in the Flutter app, including optimistic queues, resilient cache hydration, and analytics instrumentation aligned with the backend contract tests.
- Integrated production GraphQL/data streaming clients, feature flag governance, and real-time feed streaming in the Flutter app to align mobile behaviour with the web routes and telemetry requirements.
- Wired secure token storage and session management through REST, GraphQL, and realtime gateways in the Flutter foundation, and introduced an auto-telemetry service emitting network/GraphQL/realtime metrics into the analytics pipeline for live dashboards.
- Established enterprise CI/CD with a GitHub Actions quality gate covering melos-driven analysis, unit/widget/golden/integration suites plus coverage uploads, and a Codemagic release workflow that produces signed Android App Bundles and iOS IPAs for beta distribution.
- Hardened the Node.js messaging backend with support-case aware inbox logic, HTTP controllers, and a support escalation migration, pairing Sequelize caching strategies with end-to-end Jest coverage for both service and REST flows.
- Stabilised discovery listings by introducing dialect-aware LIKE fallbacks, deterministic ordering, and defensive error handling so analytics dashboards and search clients receive consistent pagination metadata across SQLite and production databases.
- Completed the Communication & Engagement milestone: added JWT-backed authentication middleware, a production-grade feed engagement service with reactions/comments/shares, Cloud-friendly migrations, and coordinated web messaging UI (floating inbox bubble, real-time analytics hooks) aligned with the updated backend contracts and caching policies.
- Delivered the Trust, Payments & Compliance milestone foundations by standing up escrow accounts/transactions, dispute case/event models, Cloudflare R2 evidence storage, and an operations-focused React Trust Center that visualises escrow health, dispute load, and release queues with live API integrations.
- Re-baselined the Task 3 readiness metrics to 92% overall after Trust Center launch, Cloudflare R2 evidence alignment, and finance operations hand-off, updating programme trackers and risk logs accordingly.
- Provisioned production-grade Meilisearch search fabric with opportunity indexes, synonym packs, ranking rules, CLI ingestion, and automated bootstrap wiring so discovery APIs now serve fresh jobs/gigs/projects/launchpad/volunteer data across web and Flutter clients.
- Delivered the production Explorer UI overhaul with geo-bounded map view, advanced filter drawer facets, saved-search alerts, and analytics instrumentation wired to the new discovery and subscription services for jobs, gigs, projects, launchpad cohorts, and volunteering.
- Completed the freelance auto-assign engine spanning Node.js services, REST controllers, notification fan-out, and React/Flutter/provider design specs documenting queue UX, scorecards, countdown timers, overrides, and analytics hooks to unlock production rollout.
- Extended the project management module with transactional event logging, regenerative auto-assign queues, and a React project detail workspace that surfaces queue composition, activity history, and budget governance with production-ready styling.
- Introduced authenticated project ownership, a `/dashboard/overview` API, and a post-login operations dashboard combining queue telemetry, saved-search alerts, and portfolio KPIs; React header/login flows now persist JWT sessions while project services enforce owner-scoped updates.
