# Version 1.10 Update Change Log

- Removed all provider phone app artifacts (documentation, evaluations, tests, and UI assets) from the update package to reflect the retirement of the provider mobile experience.
- Expanded pre-update evaluations with deep-dive findings across backend, dependency, database, web, and user app surfaces, including new full-scan sections covering runtime guard drift, tooling conflicts, and mobile bootstrap fragility.
- Completed Task 1 hardening: consolidated backend bootstrap lifecycle, released authenticated/paginated health endpoints, and added schema-driven runtime configuration with CI validation tooling.
