# Version 1.00 Update Change Log

## Task 1 â€“ Platform Bootstrap & Security Hardening
- Delivered event-driven runtime orchestration with deterministic startup/shutdown, preventing duplicate worker registration and
  enforcing circuit breakers on dependency failures.
- Implemented schema-validated configuration management, `.env` templating, secrets resolution workflow, and CI validation
  scripts to eliminate configuration drift.
- Hardened health endpoints with authentication, pagination, queue depth reporting, and structured outage codes; deprecated the
  unauthenticated `/health` alias.
- Standardised logging, CSP policies, and correlation IDs across HTTP and worker processes.
- Shipped operator tooling: admin runtime console, lifecycle event stream, runbooks, automated readiness checks, and build
  pipeline gates.
- Added mobile diagnostics integration so Flutter clients surface maintenance notices and queue health alongside the web admin
  console.
