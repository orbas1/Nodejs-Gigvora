# Version 1.10 Update Change Log

- Removed all provider phone app artifacts (documentation, evaluations, tests, and UI assets) from the update package to reflect the retirement of the provider mobile experience.
- Completed production-grade mobile experience audit (22 screens) capturing analytics drop-offs, accessibility gaps, and stakeholder requirements to feed Version 1.00 redesign backlog.
