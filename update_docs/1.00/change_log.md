# Version 1.10 Update Change Log

- Removed all provider phone app artifacts (documentation, evaluations, tests, and UI assets) from the update package to reflect the retirement of the provider mobile experience.
- Established Flutter monorepo structure with shared foundation/design-system packages, GetIt-driven dependency injection, and a production-ready blue design token loader powering the mobile theme.
