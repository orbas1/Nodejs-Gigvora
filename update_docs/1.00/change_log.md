# Version 1.10 Update Change Log

- Removed all provider phone app artifacts (documentation, evaluations, tests, and UI assets) from the update package to reflect the retirement of the provider mobile experience.
- Established Flutter monorepo structure with shared foundation/design-system packages, GetIt-driven dependency injection, and a production-ready blue design token loader powering the mobile theme.
- Activated offline-first chat, feed, marketplace, and ads modules in the Flutter app, including optimistic queues, resilient cache hydration, and analytics instrumentation aligned with the backend contract tests.
- Integrated production GraphQL/data streaming clients, feature flag governance, and real-time feed streaming in the Flutter app to align mobile behaviour with the web routes and telemetry requirements.
- Wired secure token storage and session management through REST, GraphQL, and realtime gateways in the Flutter foundation, and introduced an auto-telemetry service emitting network/GraphQL/realtime metrics into the analytics pipeline for live dashboards.
- Established enterprise CI/CD with a GitHub Actions quality gate covering melos-driven analysis, unit/widget/golden/integration suites plus coverage uploads, and a Codemagic release workflow that produces signed Android App Bundles and iOS IPAs for beta distribution.
- Hardened the Node.js messaging backend with support-case aware inbox logic, HTTP controllers, and a support escalation migration, pairing Sequelize caching strategies with end-to-end Jest coverage for both service and REST flows.
- Stabilised discovery listings by introducing dialect-aware LIKE fallbacks, deterministic ordering, and defensive error handling so analytics dashboards and search clients receive consistent pagination metadata across SQLite and production databases.
- Completed the Communication & Engagement milestone: added JWT-backed authentication middleware, a production-grade feed engagement service with reactions/comments/shares, Cloud-friendly migrations, and coordinated web messaging UI (floating inbox bubble, real-time analytics hooks) aligned with the updated backend contracts and caching policies.
- Delivered the Trust, Payments & Compliance milestone foundations by standing up escrow accounts/transactions, dispute case/event models, Cloudflare R2 evidence storage, and an operations-focused React Trust Center that visualises escrow health, dispute load, and release queues with live API integrations.
- Re-baselined the Task 3 readiness metrics to 92% overall after Trust Center launch, Cloudflare R2 evidence alignment, and finance operations hand-off, updating programme trackers and risk logs accordingly.
- Provisioned production-grade Meilisearch search fabric with opportunity indexes, synonym packs, ranking rules, CLI ingestion, and automated bootstrap wiring so discovery APIs now serve fresh jobs/gigs/projects/launchpad/volunteer data across web and Flutter clients.
- Delivered the production Explorer UI overhaul with geo-bounded map view, advanced filter drawer facets, saved-search alerts, and analytics instrumentation wired to the new discovery and subscription services for jobs, gigs, projects, launchpad cohorts, and volunteering.
- Completed the freelance auto-assign engine spanning Node.js services, REST controllers, notification fan-out, and React/Flutter/provider design specs documenting queue UX, scorecards, countdown timers, overrides, and analytics hooks to unlock production rollout.
- Extended the project management module with transactional event logging, regenerative auto-assign queues, and a React project detail workspace that surfaces queue composition, activity history, and budget governance with production-ready styling.
- Launched Experience Launchpad employer/talent workflows with new cohort readiness scoring APIs, employer intake services, placement telemetry, seeded analytics, and a redesigned web Launchpad page featuring production-grade talent and employer forms tied to live dashboards.
- Hardened discovery/search services by sharing the remote-role detector between Meilisearch indexing and REST DTOs, deduplicating stored subscription filters, and updating launchpad scoring tests to reflect the production auto-accept thresholds now powering the new workflows.
- Delivered the Volunteers Hub end-to-end with Sequelize volunteer, invitation, and impact models plus migrations, service/controller layers, REST routes, analytics emitters, and Jest suites; React Volunteering page now renders personalised invitations, commitments, hour logging, and recommendation widgets backed by the new API.
- Stabilised the profile update service so sanitised skill arrays persist through Sequelize TEXT columns, trust-score breakdowns refresh deterministically, and Experience Launchpad/Volunteer dashboards ingest the same payloads surfaced by the React Profile Editorâ€”backed by a green backend regression suite.
- Delivered the React profile editor drawer with inline validation, trust-score breakdown visualisation, credential cards, and portfolio evidence management, syncing availability focus areas and cache updates directly through the hardened `updateProfile` service to unlock Launchpad and volunteer eligibility workflows.
- Re-engineered the profile trust score service into a production 100-point model weighting profile foundation, social proof, Launchpad readiness, volunteer impact, jobs delivery, availability freshness, and compliance signals; surfaced granular breakdown metadata to the React insights module, emitted review cadence guidance, and backed the change with targeted Jest coverage confirming an 80.15 baseline score for programme reporting.
- Established a profile engagement aggregation pipeline featuring appreciation/follower schemas, a queue-backed reconciliation worker, and cache-aware service hooks so likes/followers counters remain production-accurate for trust analytics, discovery boosts, and Launchpad/volunteer targeting surfaces.
- Instrumented profile analytics with dedicated trust delta, engagement refresh, and funnel stage events that stream structured payloads into the analytics warehouse, unlock automated targeting dashboards, and verify queue reasons through new Jest coverage in `profileEngagementService` and `profileService` tests.
