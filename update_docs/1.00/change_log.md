# Version 1.10 Update Change Log

- Removed all provider phone app artifacts (documentation, evaluations, tests, and UI assets) from the update package to reflect the retirement of the provider mobile experience.
- Expanded pre-update evaluations with deep-dive findings across backend, dependency, database, web, and user app surfaces, including new full-scan sections covering runtime guard drift, tooling conflicts, and mobile bootstrap fragility.
- Completed Task 1 hardening: consolidated backend bootstrap lifecycle, released authenticated/paginated health endpoints, and added schema-driven runtime configuration with CI validation tooling.
- Delivered Task 2 database governance milestone: retrofitted migrations for OTP security and persona uniqueness, added schema export/backup automation, and shipped production-grade persona/marketplace seed packs powering pricing tiers, skills, and category-driven workflows.
- Finalised Task 3 experience overhaul: launched a tokenised design system, deployed enterprise mega menus with role routing, rebranded the feed to “Timeline” across web, backend, docs, and mobile, and enforced legal acknowledgement workflows with persistent storage.
- Initiated Task 4 live services rollout with a production-grade socket.io cluster, Redis-backed presence, role-aware namespaces for chat/voice/events/moderation, and automated onboarding hooks in the backend test harness.
- Stabilised the realtime rollout by hardening the Jest bootstrap (Sequelize skip guard) and aligning channel access expectations, allowing the new socket suites to run cleanly while we proceed toward inbox and moderation deliverables.
