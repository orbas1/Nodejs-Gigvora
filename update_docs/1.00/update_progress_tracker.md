## Cross-Task Risk Watchlist
- Compliance approvals and FCA sandbox access remain critical path items for Task 3; mitigation includes weekly legal syncs.
- Messaging and live feed infrastructure (Task 2) needs capacity planning to sustain expected load increases; infra tickets open.
- Issue/fix registers still empty; Milestone 1 subtask includes workshops to capture outstanding defects.

## Next Update
- Refresh metrics after Milestone 1 closure reviews and integrate beta readiness scores for Flutter modules and live feed backend.
