## Notes
- Overall percentage equals the arithmetic mean of the six tracked dimensions for each row. With all metrics at 100%, the release meets the Version 1.00 readiness target.
- Backend test harness relies on `SKIP_SEQUELIZE_BOOTSTRAP=true` to accelerate realtime suites; scripts are captured in `update_tests/test_scripts/backend_test_script.md`.
- Database schema snapshots are generated via `npm run schema:export`; encrypted backups can be produced and verified with `npm run db:backup` and `npm run db:verify`.
