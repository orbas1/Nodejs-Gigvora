## Cross-Task Risk Watchlist
- All critical risks logged during Version 1.00 have been mitigated; incident registers and telemetry alerts are now owned by operations.
- Residual monitoring focuses on throughput spikes in messaging/feed services and on ads spend reconciliation. Both areas have automated dashboards with pager integration.
- Issue/fix registers now contain the final resolved backlog plus a zero-defect confirmation signed by QA and compliance leads.

## Next Update
- Shift focus to Version 1.01 planning: scope backlog triage workshops, identify quick-win optimisations from launch telemetry, and outline cross-squad objectives for monetisation growth.
- Transition this tracker to read-only state after the post-launch hypercare review, archiving metrics alongside the end-of-update report for historical reference.
- Establish cadence for quarterly health checks to ensure parity between mobile, web, and provider apps as new features roll in.

## Design Update – Supplementary Metrics (Reference)
- The design tracker closes at **100% overall**, with imagery, accessibility audits, and QA execution all certified complete.
- Final sign-off bundles accessibility matrices, motion specs, and asset exports for engineering reference; the artefacts are archived alongside implementation checklists for Version 1.01 onboarding.
- Design and engineering leads now run a shared backlog review covering long-term experimentation ideas, ensuring Version 1.01 inherits validated concepts without rework.
