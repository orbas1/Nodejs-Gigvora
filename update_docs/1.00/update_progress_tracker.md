# Version 1.00 – Progress Tracker

Progress metrics are updated twice weekly. Overall level is the average of Security, Completion, Integration, Functionality, Error Free, and Production percentages.

| Task | Security | Completion | Integration | Functionality | Error Free | Production | Overall | Commentary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Task 1 – Flutter App Platform & Mobile Integration | 74% | 82% | 80% | 78% | 72% | 76% | 77% | GitHub Actions and Codemagic pipelines now execute melos-managed analysis, unit/widget/golden/integration suites with coverage, publish Android/iOS release artefacts, and gate merges on telemetry-backed health checks; focus shifts to CI runbook automation and telemetry dashboard UX polish. |
| Task 2 – Communication & Engagement Suite | 68% | 82% | 78% | 84% | 72% | 76% | 77% | Support-case aware inboxing now powers production-ready APIs, authentication guards, and Jest suites; floating chat bubble, live feed reactions/comments/shares, and dialected ranking have landed across web and Node.js services with staging telemetry clean. |
| Task 3 – Trust, Payments & Infrastructure Compliance | 88% | 100% | 92% | 94% | 90% | 88% | 92% | Escrow accounts/transactions, dispute workflows, Cloudflare R2 evidence handling, Trust Center dashboard, and operations runbook are live with Jest coverage; finance automation hand-off complete and compliance sign-off received. |
| Task 4 – Discovery, Matching & Experience Automation | 68% | 78% | 74% | 82% | 70% | 76% | 75% | Auto-assign engine is live with production Node.js services, queue promotion logic, analytics events, and opt-in preferences; Experience Launchpad workflows now include seeded cohorts, readiness scoring, employer/talent intake forms, placements insights, and refreshed wireframes/documentation across web, Flutter, and provider artefacts, with regression packs queued for volunteer hub follow-up. |
| Task 5 – Profiles, User Types & Employment Systems | 24% | 11% | 13% | 15% | 17% | 9% | 15% | Profile schema proposal under review; ATS scope validated; jobs board, launchpad, and volunteer data models queued for migration sign-off. |
| Task 6 – Project, Gig & Operations Management | 32% | 28% | 26% | 34% | 28% | 24% | 29% | Project workspace API now logs transactional updates, regenerates queues, and exposes the new React management surface; milestones/chat scaffolding and gig analytics remain in flight. |
| Task 7 – Monetisation & Brand Refresh | 30% | 13% | 14% | 16% | 18% | 9% | 17% | Homepage redesign concepts approved; ads billing integration discovery ongoing. |

## Cross-Task Risk Watchlist
- Trust Center telemetry depends on nightly ledger export automation staying healthy; finance ops now monitors drift and raises incidents if deltas exceed 0.5%.
- Messaging and live feed infrastructure (Task 2) needs capacity planning to sustain expected load increases; infra tickets remain open until horizontal scaling tests conclude.
- Issue/fix registers still empty; Milestone 1 subtask includes workshops to capture outstanding defects.
- Flutter mobile automated tests no longer blocked—GitHub Actions now exercises melos-driven test suites and Codemagic distributes signed builds. Remaining risk is local developer parity with CI environment images.
- Meilisearch API keys and ingestion scripts now run in staging/production; platform ops must wire rotation and Datadog alerts for indexing lag to keep discovery uptime high.

## Next Update
- Track auto-assign service bring-up alongside Experience Launchpad integration while folding volunteer imagery QA outcomes into the next report.
- Monitor explorer saved-search adoption and geo map performance metrics as the new UI rolls through staging and beta cohorts.

## Design Update – Supplementary Metrics (Reference)
- The dedicated design tracker (`Design_update_progress_tracker.md`) now averages **82% overall**, with the largest remaining gaps in imagery (68%) and accessibility test coverage (74%).
- Gains in design quality (85%) and organisation (80%) reflect the inclusion of Trust Center specs alongside engagement artefacts; wallet imagery and accessibility audits remain open.
- Product and engineering leads should continue pairing with design to lift QA execution (78%) and usability validation (80%) so that implementation sprints inherit fully vetted specifications.
