## Cross-Track Actions
- Schedule joint accessibility and legal reviews to accelerate compliance scores.
- Prioritise imagery sourcing and asset management for both platforms.
- Launch moderated usability studies to feed into milestone M3 deliverables.
- Formalise QA engagement with component-level acceptance criteria and regression plans.
- Convert mobile audit findings into annotated wireframes and accessibility backlog ahead of M1 sign-off.
