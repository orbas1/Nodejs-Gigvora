## Notes
- Overall percentage equals the arithmetic mean of the six tracked dimensions for each row. With all metrics at 0%, overall remains 0% until execution begins.
- Update this tracker alongside implementation to reflect incremental progress, ensuring milestone readiness assessments remain data-driven.
- Database schema snapshots are generated via `npm run schema:export`; encrypted backups can be produced and verified with `npm run db:backup` and `npm run db:verify`.
