# Version 1.00 – Progress Tracker

Progress metrics are updated twice weekly. Overall level is the average of Security, Completion, Integration, Functionality, Error Free, and Production percentages.

| Task | Security | Completion | Integration | Functionality | Error Free | Production | Overall | Commentary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Task 1 – Flutter App Platform & Mobile Integration | 74% | 82% | 80% | 78% | 72% | 76% | 77% | GitHub Actions and Codemagic pipelines now execute melos-managed analysis, unit/widget/golden/integration suites with coverage, publish Android/iOS release artefacts, and gate merges on telemetry-backed health checks; focus shifts to CI runbook automation and telemetry dashboard UX polish. |
| Task 2 – Communication & Engagement Suite | 68% | 82% | 78% | 84% | 72% | 76% | 77% | Support-case aware inboxing now powers production-ready APIs, authentication guards, and Jest suites; floating chat bubble, live feed reactions/comments/shares, and dialected ranking have landed across web and Node.js services with staging telemetry clean. |
| Task 3 – Trust, Payments & Infrastructure Compliance | 88% | 100% | 92% | 94% | 90% | 88% | 92% | Escrow accounts/transactions, dispute workflows, Cloudflare R2 evidence handling, Trust Center dashboard, and operations runbook are live with Jest coverage; finance automation hand-off complete and compliance sign-off received. |
| Task 4 – Discovery, Matching & Experience Automation | 78% | 90% | 86% | 92% | 80% | 84% | 85% | Volunteers Hub is now production-ready with Sequelize migrations, REST controllers, analytics emitters, and React dashboards exposing personalised invites, commitment tracking, hour logging, and recommendation streams. Auto-assign and Launchpad services continue to operate with refreshed documentation, and cross-platform telemetry now includes volunteer impact metrics wired into Meilisearch/analytics for rollout. |
| Task 5 – Profiles, User Types & Employment Systems | 66% | 86% | 80% | 91% | 75% | 82% | 80% | Agency dashboard now ships the HR command centre with production role coverage, staffing capacity, compliance alerting, and onboarding intelligence wired into the refreshed backend service. React widgets surface colour-coded alerts, policy backlog, availability breakdowns, and onboarding queues while the Node.js service aggregates role, pipeline, and policy metrics with deterministic caching. The payments distribution module adds live payout analytics, export readiness, and outstanding split monitoring with new Jest coverage. |
| Task 6 – Project, Gig & Operations Management | 32% | 28% | 26% | 34% | 28% | 24% | 29% | Project workspace API now logs transactional updates, regenerates queues, and exposes the new React management surface; milestones/chat scaffolding and gig analytics remain in flight. Detailed subtask slices now map gig wizard, project module, and reporting deliverables to unblock sequencing discussions. |
| Task 7 – Monetisation & Brand Refresh | 30% | 13% | 14% | 16% | 18% | 9% | 17% | Homepage redesign concepts approved; ads billing integration discovery ongoing. The monetisation and brand backlog has been broken into smaller execution tranches (homepage, design system, ads, CDN, marketing) to improve cadence tracking. |

## Cross-Task Risk Watchlist
- Trust Center telemetry depends on nightly ledger export automation staying healthy; finance ops now monitors drift and raises incidents if deltas exceed 0.5%.
- Messaging and live feed infrastructure (Task 2) needs capacity planning to sustain expected load increases; infra tickets remain open until horizontal scaling tests conclude.
- Issue/fix registers still empty; Milestone 1 subtask includes workshops to capture outstanding defects.
- Flutter mobile automated tests no longer blocked—GitHub Actions now exercises melos-driven test suites and Codemagic distributes signed builds. Remaining risk is local developer parity with CI environment images.
- Meilisearch API keys and ingestion scripts now run in staging/production; platform ops must wire rotation and Datadog alerts for indexing lag to keep discovery uptime high.

## Next Update
- Track auto-assign service bring-up alongside Experience Launchpad integration while folding volunteer imagery QA outcomes into the next report.
- Monitor explorer saved-search adoption and geo map performance metrics as the new UI rolls through staging and beta cohorts.
- Measure the agency payments distribution dashboard roll-out (Task 5.3b) across staging tenants, capture finance export feedback, and tune alert thresholds so KPIs reuse the staffing summary patterns without duplication.

## Design Update – Supplementary Metrics (Reference)
- The dedicated design tracker (`Design_update_progress_tracker.md`) now averages **95% overall**, with the largest remaining gaps in imagery (74%) and accessibility test coverage (74%).
- Gains in design quality (93%) and organisation (91%) reflect the inclusion of the profile editor drawer blueprint, the agency HR command centre specification, the new finance distribution kit, Trust Center specs, and engagement artefacts; wallet imagery and accessibility audits remain open.
- Product and engineering leads should continue pairing with design to lift QA execution (78%) and usability validation (82%) so that implementation sprints inherit fully vetted specifications.
