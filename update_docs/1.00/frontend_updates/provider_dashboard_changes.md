# Provider Dashboard Updates â€“ Task 3

## Overview
- Consolidated the provider dashboard into a single navigation surface that inherits the global design tokens, mega menu entry points, and responsive grid refinements delivered in Task 3.
- Ensured every module is backed by live data sources (gigs, projects, bookings, analytics, finance) with empty-state copy that points users to the Creation Studio wizard or import pipelines when no records exist.
- Introduced deterministic loading skeletons so providers receive immediate feedback while API calls hydrate the workspace.

## Navigation & Layout
- Added a left-anchored workspace switcher that lists gig management, project delivery, clients/CRM, finance, analytics, documents, and support modules with badge indicators for pending actions.
- Implemented a persistent header action bar that exposes quick actions (create gig, log time, raise invoice) and displays status pills for wallet balance, escrow holds, and compliance alerts.
- Delivered responsive breakpoints that collapse secondary metrics into drawers on tablets and stack cards vertically on mobile while retaining readability and touch targets.

## Workspace Modules
- **Gig & Project Pipelines:** Introduced kanban boards with drag-and-drop stages, SLA timers, and inline messaging that sync with the realtime events namespace; RBAC ensures only `provider:manage` operators can move items across revenue-impacting stages.
- **Client CRM:** Embedded contact directories, onboarding checklists, renewal reminders, and smart tags that mirror analytics-driven lead scoring. Permissions respect `crm:view`/`crm:manage` scopes and hide edit actions for viewers.
- **Calendar & Availability:** Surfaced integrated calendar views with filterable service categories, leveraging the shared timeline terminology and respecting CORS-safe ICS export endpoints.

## Financial Controls
- Centralised wallet, escrow, invoice, and payout summaries inside a unified finance card stack with drilldowns for tax documents, transaction disputes, and forecast projections.
- Added compliance checklists that surface outstanding KYC, VAT, or banking tasks with direct links to verification flows. Cards honor finance RBAC scopes and degrade gracefully with masked data for read-only roles.
- Wired downloadable CSV exports behind signed URLs returned by the backend to maintain secure, short-lived CORS policies.

## Collaboration & Support
- Embedded the Chatwoot support bubble and inbox preview panes directly into the dashboard footer so providers can see unread threads without leaving their workspace.
- Added a live service telemetry ribbon summarising timeline health, message delivery status, and incident posture so providers know whether to pause campaigns or client outreach.
- Surfaced knowledge base highlights and policy updates within the right rail, ensuring providers stay informed of new guidelines and monetisation opportunities.

## Accessibility, Performance & Observability
- All interactive elements meet WCAG 2.2 AA standards with keyboard focus states, ARIA labelling, and high-contrast palettes tied to the new token system.
- Implemented code-splitting for heavy analytics widgets and deferred loading for optional integrations (e.g., HubSpot, Salesforce) so first paint stays under performance budgets.
- Instrumented dashboards with structured logging and analytics events (viewed module, used quick action, exported report) to feed the cross-platform telemetry pipeline.
