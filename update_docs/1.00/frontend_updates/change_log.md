# Task 3 Frontend Change Log

- Implemented the Gigvora design system tokens (`src/index.css`) with CSS variables for typography, colour, radius, spacing, and selection styling to anchor responsive behaviour across React and Flutter shells.
- Replaced the legacy header with an enterprise mega menu (`Header.jsx`, `MegaMenu.jsx`, `RoleSwitcher.jsx`, `navigation.js`) delivering role-aware routing, authenticated quick actions, and marketing journey links.
- Added a persistent policy acknowledgement banner (`PolicyAcknowledgementBanner.jsx`) to surface Terms/Privacy/Refund updates and store consent in localStorage per member ID.
- Promoted Creation Studio access with new header CTAs and ensured timeline-first navigation flows by default for authenticated members.
