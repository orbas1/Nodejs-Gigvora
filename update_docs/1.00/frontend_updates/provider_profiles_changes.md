# Provider Profile Updates – Task 3

## Profile Architecture
- Rebuilt provider profiles around modular sections (hero summary, availability, portfolio, reviews, compliance) fed by live service APIs to eliminate placeholder copy.
- Introduced contextual action buttons (book consultation, request quote, share brief) that respect user RBAC and display alternative CTAs when the viewer lacks booking permissions.
- Added timeline-aligned activity feeds that highlight recent gigs, project milestones, and community participation with filters for potential clients vs. collaborators.

## Visual & Content Refresh
- Applied the unified design tokens for typography, spacing, and colour accents, ensuring hero banners, badges, and CTA pills remain accessible across light/dark modes.
- Crafted responsive media grids for case studies and credentials with auto-generated alt text fields, download options for certifications, and optional NDAs for sensitive assets.
- Enforced character limits and inline validation for bios, service descriptions, and pricing fields to maintain consistency across locales.

## Credibility & Compliance
- Embedded verification chips (ID verified, insurance uploaded, GDPR compliant) with hover tooltips linking to policy documentation and support resources.
- Surfaced finance readiness indicators (wallet connected, payout method verified, escrow eligible) sourced from the finance microservice so prospects know providers can transact immediately.
- Added audit trails for profile edits, exposing last updated timestamps and change summaries to admins for compliance tracking.

## Collaboration & Communication
- Integrated "Start chat" and "Schedule session" actions that launch the inbox or calendar modals with prefilled context, respecting CORS-validated API endpoints.
- Provided shareable profile snapshots with deep links that include campaign tracking parameters for marketing attribution.
- Added customer review request workflows with templated messages and moderation hooks to prevent policy violations.

## Accessibility & Performance
- Delivered semantic markup with ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and focus management for tabbed sections.
- Deferred loading of heavy media (video showcases, 3D tours) until the user interacts with the gallery, improving initial load time.
- Instrumented profile view analytics to capture conversion funnels (view ➜ CTA click ➜ booking submitted) for growth insights.
