# Front-End Page Updates â€“ Communication & Engagement Suite

## Feed Page (`src/pages/FeedPage.jsx`)
- Added optimistic reaction handling with local state reconciliation after API response; supports five reaction types with viewer-state toggles.
- Implemented inline comment drawer fetching comments lazily, displaying skeleton loaders, and surfacing retry copy when errors occur.
- Introduced share composer modal that records shares, updates metrics, and closes automatically on success while logging analytics.
- Added pagination awareness, timestamp of last refresh, and error fallbacks via `DataStatus` for network issues.

## Global Layout (`src/layouts/MainLayout.jsx`)
- Mounted floating `ChatBubble` inside the main layout so messaging access persists across routes without interfering with existing z-index stacks.
- Ensured bubble respects responsive breakpoints, hides on print viewports, and defers loading messaging bundle until user interaction to control performance.

## Messaging Bubble (`src/components/ChatBubble.jsx`)
- Provides inbox list with search filtering, unread badges, support/composer shortcuts, and skeleton states while fetching.
- Thread view renders messages with author alignment, relative timestamps, and resilience to unauthenticated states (sign-in prompt).
- Composer modal handles optimistic sends, error recovery, and analytics instrumentation for conversation creation.

## Supporting Services & Hooks
- `useMessagingCenter` centralises state management (threads, selected thread, messages) and exports handlers consumed by the bubble UI.
- `messagingClient.js` and `feedClient.js` encapsulate API calls, attach auth headers, and expose typed responses used by React components.

## Trust Center (`src/pages/TrustCenter.jsx`)
- New operations dashboard surfaces escrow totals, dispute workload, release queues, and R2 evidence health with blue-branded UI blocks aligned to the design system.
- Inline release action buttons call the escrow release endpoint and refresh the overview while presenting success/error banners.
- Integrates bucketed release metrics, dispute cards with SLA visibility, and compliance messaging for Cloudflare R2 evidence pipelines.
