# Serviceman Profile Updates â€“ Task 3

## Profile Structure
- Reoriented serviceman profiles around at-a-glance readiness (skills, certifications, availability) with hero cards that surface response times, travel radius, and languages.
- Introduced modular sections for past assignments, performance metrics, and safety record, each loading independently for resilience.

## Content & Media Enhancements
- Added location-aware service areas with interactive maps, zone filters, and travel surcharge calculators.
- Enabled upload galleries for before/after photos, incident documentation, and compliance certificates with automatic redaction controls for sensitive data.
- Provided templated summaries for equipment proficiency and emergency response capabilities, ensuring consistent wording across the marketplace.

## Trust & Compliance Signals
- Displayed verification badges (background check, insurance, certifications) with expiration reminders and direct links for supervisors to request renewals.
- Surfaced safety training logs and incident resolution history, giving clients confidence in on-site professionalism.
- Linked policy acknowledgements and the latest safety bulletin acceptance state to ensure field staff remain compliant.

## Interaction & Support
- Offered quick contact options (call, message, schedule follow-up) gated by RBAC so only authorised clients or supervisors can initiate outreach.
- Embedded escalation workflows that notify operations leads when a serviceman flags an issue from their profile.
- Added feedback prompts that encourage clients to rate recent jobs, with moderation flows to maintain quality standards.

## Accessibility & Performance
- Ensured responsive layouts for ruggedised tablets and mobile devices used in the field, including large tap targets and offline caching.
- Applied WCAG-compliant colour contrasts and focus rings, enabling keyboard-only navigation for accessibility audits.
- Instrumented analytics to measure profile views, quote requests, and conversion rates for operations oversight.
