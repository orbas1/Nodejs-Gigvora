# Serviceman Dashboard Updates â€“ Task 3

## Overview
- Tailored the serviceman dashboard for individual field contractors who deliver on-site services, aligning copy and data models with the new Timeline terminology and compliance flows.
- Synced navigation with the provider dashboard while prioritising task assignment, route planning, and compliance acknowledgements required for field operations.

## Task & Schedule Management
- Added a "Today" overview card summarising assigned jobs, travel time, and required equipment with status chips (On Track, Requires Attention) driven by live telemetry.
- Introduced a calendar and map hybrid view that plots service locations, integrates with the logistics microservice, and supports offline caching for rural coverage scenarios.
- Enabled drag-to-reschedule interactions with conflict detection, ensuring supervisors with `operations:manage` scopes approve changes before they publish.

## Work Order Execution
- Embedded step-by-step job checklists, safety protocols, and client notes sourced from the backend, complete with signature capture and photo upload widgets.
- Added quick access buttons to initiate chats, escalate incidents, or request additional parts, routing through the realtime events namespace and respecting RBAC.
- Provided automated time tracking that starts when a serviceman checks in on-site and syncs with payroll/finance modules for accurate billing.

## Compliance & Safety
- Surfaced policy acknowledgements (latest safety bulletin, insurance confirmation) using the same consent storage strategy as the global banner but scoped per serviceman profile.
- Displayed certification expiry counters with alerts and workflow links so contractors renew credentials before on-site visits.
- Integrated incident reporting shortcuts with templated forms and secure media uploads, ensuring sensitive content follows hardened CORS and storage policies.

## Support & Communication
- Embedded Chatwoot-based support entry points plus supervisor escalation controls that prefill job context to minimise back-and-forth.
- Added broadcast alerts for outages or weather disruptions, with acknowledgement tracking to verify servicemen saw critical updates.
- Provided a knowledge base carousel featuring SOPs, troubleshooting guides, and quick reference cards optimised for mobile.

## Performance & Observability
- Introduced progress heatmaps and KPI widgets (first-time fix rate, customer satisfaction, time-to-site) generated from analytics services.
- Implemented skeleton loaders and offline-first caching so mission-critical data stays available even during network instability.
- Captured analytics events for every task interaction, reschedule request, and incident report to help operations refine workflows.
