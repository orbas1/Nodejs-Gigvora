# User Profile Updates â€“ Task 3

## Profile Foundations
- Standardised user profiles across web and mobile, ensuring personal information, experience timeline, and community badges stay in sync via shared services.
- Added hero sections with concise bio, role chips, and progress indicators for onboarding completion, privacy preferences, and security posture (2FA status).

## Personalisation & Activity
- Introduced timeline widgets that surface recent activity (courses completed, communities joined, posts published) with filters for public vs. private visibility.
- Enabled goal tracking with milestones that tie into mentorship or gig recommendations, providing celebratory animations and suggestions when users hit thresholds.
- Added dynamic recommendations for connections, mentors, and learning resources based on matching engines while exposing rationale for transparency.

## Privacy & Security Controls
- Centralised privacy settings, allowing members to toggle visibility for contact info, work history, and community participation with contextual education.
- Surfaced device management and session history with one-click revoke actions; RBAC ensures admins can audit without modifying personal data.
- Integrated consent logs for policy updates, marketing preferences, and data processing agreements, mirroring backend compliance requirements.

## Collaboration & Support
- Added quick actions to start chats, schedule mentoring sessions, or join volunteer projects, each respecting RBAC scopes and presenting upgrade paths when access is restricted.
- Embedded support shortcuts (open ticket, view help articles) and surfaced proactive tips when the platform detects repeated errors or failed actions.
- Provided profile sharing and export options with signed URLs and downloadable resumes while preserving secure CORS handling.

## Accessibility & Performance
- Delivered adaptive layouts that prioritise readability on mobile and desktop, with accessible colour schemes and font scaling.
- Deferred heavy widgets (analytics insights, large media) until the user expands relevant sections, keeping initial load light.
- Captured analytics across profile edits, privacy changes, and recommendation interactions to feed experimentation and product decisions.
