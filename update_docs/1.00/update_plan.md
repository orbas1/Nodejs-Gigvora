# Version 1.00 Update Plan

## Purpose
This plan translates the requirements from `new_feature_brief.md`, `features_update_plan.md`, `features_to_add.md`, and the findings in `issue_report.md`, `issue_list.md`, and `fix_suggestions.md` into an executable release roadmap. It balances large-scale feature delivery (UX overhaul, community collaboration, intelligent matching, finance/dashboard unification, and mobile parity) with critical remediation (security hardening, database governance, dependency alignment, and operational readiness). The plan ensures each task is paired with clear ownership, cross-surface integration, and validation gates so the release can ship with production-grade quality.

## Objectives
1. **Stabilise the platform foundation** by resolving bootstrap, configuration, security, database, and dependency issues that currently block production readiness.
2. **Deliver priority features** outlined in the feature briefs, ensuring every persona receives the refined UX, community, matching, monetisation, and dashboard capabilities promised for Version 1.00, including a full website UI overhaul across every page, screen, and role-specific dashboard.
3. **Achieve cross-platform parity** so the React front-end, Node.js backend, Flutter user app, and provider-facing experiences share aligned contracts, configuration, and behaviour.
4. **Institutionalise quality controls** through comprehensive automated/manual testing, observability, documentation, and release governance, culminating in end-of-update and changelog deliverables.

## Strategy
- **Phase Sequencing** – Execute work in five sequential tracks: (1) Platform Hardening, (2) Experience & Collaboration Delivery, (3) Intelligence & Monetisation Enablement, (4) Cross-Platform Parity, and (5) Quality Assurance & Launch. Tracks map directly to the milestone plan and task list.
- **Integration-First Design** – Every task includes backend, front-end, user phone app, provider phone app, database, API, logic, and design subsections to guarantee consistent implementation and integration testing coverage.
- **Dashboard & Page Traceability** – Maintain a catalogue of each dashboard (Admin Operations, Project/Gig Management, Talent Insights, Provider/Serviceman, Finance & Analytics, Community Moderation) and every marketing/core workflow page so design, engineering, and QA have one-to-one alignment on scope and acceptance criteria.
- **Security & Compliance Overlay** – Apply the remediation directives from the pre-update evaluations (e.g., CSP corrections, encrypted storage, authenticated metrics, schema governance) to each track before feature sign-off.
- **Documentation & Reporting** – Maintain live updates to update_milestone_list.md, update_task_list.md, update_progress_tracker.md, and produce the end_of_update_report.md and change_log.md once testing concludes.

## Dependencies & Coordination
- **Shared Contracts & Schema Governance** – Regenerate shared-contracts outputs in tandem with database migrations and mobile cache updates to avoid drift.
- **Integration Credentials & Licensing** – Secure approvals for Chatwoot, Firebase, HubSpot, Salesforce, App Store/Play Store, Apple/Google/LinkedIn/Facebook logins, Cloudflare R2/Wasabi, and compact internal intelligence deployments before integration tasks reach QA.
- **Testing Infrastructure** – Expand CI/CD runners to support Node, React, Flutter, and database test suites with MySQL-based integration testing.
- **Stakeholder Alignment** – Weekly checkpoints with product, engineering, QA, legal, and operations to review milestone burndown, risk register updates, and release-readiness metrics.

## Risk Management
- **Concurrency & Live Services** – Follow fix_suggestions for worker lifecycle management, health endpoint hardening, and queue observability before enabling large-scale chat/timeline loads.
- **Schema Drift & Data Integrity** – Enforce transaction-safe migrations with hashed secrets, OTP expirations, and MySQL-aligned data types to prevent data corruption during release.
- **Mobile Store Compliance** – Track Apple/Google submission requirements early, ensuring encryption, secure storage, and feature toggles align with policy expectations.
- **Dependency Governance** – Introduce workspace tooling, lockfile enforcement, and feature flag guards to keep heavy SDKs and optional integrations under control.

## Deliverables
- Updated `update_task_list.md`, `update_milestone_list.md`, and `update_progress_tracker.md` reflecting this plan.
- Implementation artifacts: refactored backend modules, database migrations, shared-contract regeneration, redesigned front-end components, upgraded Flutter parity, and integration configurations for every dashboard, marketing page, and core workflow screen.
- QA artifacts: automated test suites, exploratory testing scripts, load/security test reports, and release sign-off forms.
- Documentation artifacts: refreshed README/full guides, policy pages, starter data catalogs, incident runbooks, end_of_update_report.md, change_log.md, and upload_brief.md.

## Success Metrics
- Zero critical issues open at release candidate; all tasks reach ≥95% completion with passing security, functionality, and production readiness scores.
- Health, metrics, and observability endpoints authenticated and exposing actionable data; database, configuration, and dependency audits pass without exceptions.
- Mobile and web apps demonstrate feature parity, secure storage, and aligned headers/contracts, validated through automated and manual testing.
- Release documentation package accepted by stakeholders, and change_log.md accurately reflects delivered features and fixes.
