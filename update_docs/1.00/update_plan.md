# Version 1.00 – Consolidated UI/UX Update Plan

## Overview
The Version 1.00 release focuses on a dual-track design modernisation covering the **Phone Application** and **Web Application** experiences. The initiative introduces modular theming, improved navigation, enhanced booking flows, and accessibility compliance. Designs must account for theme swaps (seasonal, editorial, emo themes) and partial template injections controlled by CMS and feature flags. New page templates (hero takeovers, curated collections, support dashboards) are planned for both platforms.

## Goals
1. Elevate conversion and engagement by surfacing curated creators, campaigns, and quick actions in context.
2. Harmonise design systems across web and mobile using shared tokens, motion principles, and accessibility standards.
3. Deliver modular layouts that can be recombined or themed without redesign, enabling rapid marketing experimentation.
4. Strengthen trust, compliance, and support visibility throughout discovery and booking journeys.

## Scope Highlights
- Application: Persistent bottom navigation, dynamic hero carousel, multi-step booking stepper, refreshed messaging hub.
- Web: Mega-menu navigation, themed hero regions, responsive grid overhaul, booking configurator redesign, support dashboard.
- Shared: Tokenised design system, accessibility audits, localisation readiness, compliance copy refresh, QA handoff assets.

## Key Dependencies
- Analytics instrumentation for new navigation funnels on both platforms.
- CMS enhancements enabling partial template rendering and theme toggles.
- Backend services surfacing creator performance metrics and booking availability signals.
- Legal and security review cycles for updated compliance and authentication patterns.

- **M2 (Phone)** – Visual System Tokenisation (2024-05-30)
- **M3 (Phone)** – High-Fidelity Prototype Delivery (2024-06-10)
- **M4 (Phone)** – Pre-Launch Accessibility & QA Review (2024-06-20)
- **M1 (Web)** – Navigation & Template Architecture Approval (2024-05-18)
- **M2 (Web)** – Responsive Grid & Component Library (2024-05-28)
- **M3 (Web)** – Booking Flow Prototype & Usability Study (2024-06-07)
- **M4 (Web)** – Accessibility & Compliance Audit (2024-06-17)

## Workstreams & Task Overview
1. **Research & Audit** – Conduct baseline audits, analytics reviews, and stakeholder interviews across platforms.
2. **Information Architecture** – Redesign navigation frameworks, mega-menus, and contextual shortcuts.
3. **Design System & Theming** – Build shared token libraries, responsive grids, and component inventories.
4. **High-Fidelity Prototyping** – Deliver polished prototypes for discovery, booking, messaging/support flows.
5. **Content & Theming** – Curate imagery, copy, and theme variations including emo/seasonal motifs.
6. **Accessibility, Compliance & QA** – Execute audits, legal reviews, QA handoffs, and testing plans.

## Rollout Strategy
- **Sprint 1**: Complete audits, confirm IA direction, start theming/token architecture.
- **Sprint 2**: Finalise navigation deliverables, publish responsive system specs, begin high-fidelity renders.
- **Sprint 3**: Conduct usability testing, iterate prototypes, integrate content/theming updates.
- **Sprint 4**: Execute accessibility and compliance audits, prepare QA sign-off packages, plan phased rollout to production.

## Success Metrics
- +15% engagement on discovery modules (hero interactions, curated collection clicks).
- -20% drop-off during booking flows (mobile and web).
- Accessibility audit achieving ≥ 95% pass rate across critical journeys.
- Reduction in design-to-build defects by 30% through improved handoff documentation.

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Delays in CMS feature delivery for dynamic hero sections | Prioritise fallback static templates and schedule integration spikes with platform engineering. |
| Resource contention between mobile and web squads | Establish weekly cross-platform design syncs and shared backlog management. |
| Compliance/legal approvals lagging | Engage legal early, provide draft copy timelines, and maintain decision logs. |
| Theming complexity introduces implementation errors | Supply developer-ready token exports, conduct paired design-development reviews, and set automated lint checks. |
