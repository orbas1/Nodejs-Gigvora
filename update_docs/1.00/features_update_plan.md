# Version 1.00 Feature Update Plan

## Phase 0 – Discovery & Blueprinting
1. **Stakeholder Alignment**
   - Review `new_feature_brief.md`, change_log, and pre-update evaluations with product, engineering, QA, compliance, and operations leads.
   - Map each requirement to update_task_list.md entries and assign owners.
   - Publish a RACI matrix for every epic (UX overhaul, chat, matching, dashboards, mobile, policies) to ensure accountability and coverage.
2. **Logic Flow Authoring**
   - Produce BPMN/UML diagrams for navigation, community chat, matching, deployment, finance, and mobile flows identified in the brief.
   - Validate logic with cross-functional teams; store artifacts alongside update_docs/1.00.
   - Capture data flow diagrams covering integrations (HubSpot, Salesforce, Firebase, etc.) and security boundaries (RBAC zones, encryption checkpoints).
3. **Acceptance Criteria Definition**
   - Create user stories with acceptance criteria per module (timeline, dashboards, chat, matching, policies, etc.).
   - Link stories to automated test expectations (unit, integration, E2E, load, usage, financial, CRUD, security, RBAC, internal intelligence, networking).
   - Define measurable success metrics (latency, conversion, adoption) tied to each story and document observation methods.
4. **Environment Audit**
   - Inventory infrastructure, domains, SSL, CDN, databases, and third-party integrations.
   - Plan setup/deployment scripts or UI wizard for environment provisioning and GitHub upgrade automation.
   - Establish secrets management strategy (Vault/SSM) and environment parity requirements (dev/staging/pre-prod/prod).
5. **Intelligence Constraints & Strategy**
   - Document infrastructure limits for machine learning workloads (CPU/RAM availability, no external GPU services) and capture approved internal model types.
   - Define governance for internal algorithms (versioning, evaluation datasets, rollback procedures) and align with data/analytics leads.
