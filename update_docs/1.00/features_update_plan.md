| **Build & Integration** | Weeks 5-12 | Parallel development of Flutter app, web redesign, backend modules (escrow, disputes, project management, ads), profile expansions, search/automation engines. |
| **Stabilisation & Launch** | Weeks 13-16 | System testing, FCA sandbox approval, data migration, beta programmes, security review, marketing alignment, full release sign-off. |

## Workstreams & Step-by-Step Plan
### 1. Design & Experience
1. Audit existing UX flows and collect analytics insights on homepage, profile, and search usage.
2. Produce blue colour palette, typography scale, iconography, and component library updates in Figma.
3. Deliver wireframes for homepage, responsive web, Flutter screens (onboarding, feed, search, chat, jobs, ads, project management).
4. Run stakeholder reviews and accessibility audits (WCAG 2.1 AA) before hand-off.
5. Maintain design tokens repository (JSON) synchronised between React and Flutter.

### 2. Mobile (Flutter) Delivery
1. Establish Flutter monorepo structure with feature modules (auth, feed, messaging, projects, jobs, ads).
2. Implement shared services: networking with Retrofit/dio, secure storage, analytics instrumentation, and error logging (Sentry).
3. Build screens and navigation stacks per feature requirement; create reusable widgets for cards, forms, and modals.
4. Integrate push notifications, deep linking, and offline caching via Hive/Sqflite for critical data (messages, projects).
5. Connect to backend APIs and GraphQL endpoints; write integration tests and golden tests for UI states.
6. Configure CI/CD (Codemagic/Github Actions) for automated builds, signing, and store deployment readiness.

### 3. Web Frontend
1. Introduce blue theme via central design tokens and update Tailwind/Styled Components configuration.
2. Rebuild homepage hero, value propositions, and CTA sections with SEO-optimised content and animation polish.
3. Implement floating chat bubble, live feed components, volunteer/launchpad sections, and job board dashboards.
4. Migrate profile page to component-based architecture with new sections (agency type, qualifications, trust score, etc.).
5. Integrate Gigvora Ads management console with charts (Recharts/ECharts) and form wizards.
6. Update availability toggles, search filters, and global navigation to surface new modules.

### 4. Backend & Services
1. **Escrow & Payments**
   - Select FCA-compliant payment provider; complete risk assessment and sandbox integration plan.
   - Design escrow state machine, ledger tables, and payout workflows with double-entry bookkeeping.
   - Implement funding, release, dispute triggers, and notification hooks.
2. **Dispute Resolution**
   - Model multi-stage dispute entities, timers, and evidence storage on Cloudflare R2.
   - Build mediator/admin tooling and audit trail logging.
3. **Project Management & Collaboration**
   - Extend project schema with budgets, tasks, milestones, hourly time tracking, and group chat references.
   - Implement real-time updates via WebSockets or server-sent events for in-project chat and task status.
4. **Search & Matching**
   - Deploy Meilisearch cluster; build indexing pipelines for profiles, gigs, jobs, volunteers, launchpad projects.
   - Create ranking rules, synonyms, and segmentation filters; expose search APIs with pagination and aggregations.
   - Deliver auto-assign rules engine and matching service with retry logic and notifications.
5. **User Archetype Modules**
   - Add agency/company account types, HR and payments permissions, and job/ gig management endpoints.
   - Implement employment board, ATS pipeline, screener questions, interview scheduling (Calendar integrations), and CV storage.
6. **Ads & Analytics**
   - Create ad campaign entities, budget pacing services, billing integration, click/conversion tracking, and reporting endpoints.
7. **Infrastructure**
   - Integrate Cloudflare R2 for media uploads, generate signed URLs, and update CDN configuration.
   - Enhance monitoring dashboards for latency, error rates, and escrow transaction health.

### 5. Data & Migration
1. Draft migration scripts for profile enhancements (new tables/columns for qualifications, references, trust score metrics).
2. Backfill historical data where possible; design fallback UI for incomplete legacy records.
3. Import/transform job listings and volunteer entries into new structures.
4. Implement privacy-compliant data retention and deletion flows for new modules (GDPR).

### 6. Compliance & Legal
1. Kick-off FCA compliance review with legal counsel; document processes for escrow, disputes, and funds safeguarding.
2. Align KYC/KYB provider, data storage policies, and audit logging requirements.
3. Draft dispute resolution terms, user agreements, and consent flows for launchpad/volunteer programmes.
4. Conduct threat modelling and penetration testing for payment-related endpoints.

### 7. Quality Assurance
1. Build comprehensive test matrix covering feature acceptance criteria, edge cases, and device/browser coverage.
2. Implement automated test suites: unit (backend/frontend/flutter), integration, end-to-end (Cypress/Appium), performance, and security scans.
3. Establish staging environment with production-like data; run regression and exploratory cycles per sprint.
4. Coordinate beta testing cohorts for Flutter app, live feed, and project management modules; collect feedback loops.
5. Prepare release certification checklist and sign-off documentation.

### 8. Release & Change Management
1. Configure feature flags for high-risk modules (escrow, ads, auto-assign, disputes) with kill-switch capability.
2. Train support and success teams on new flows, escalation paths, and analytics dashboards.
3. Update knowledge base, onboarding emails, and in-app walkthroughs to highlight Version 1.00 improvements.
4. Plan phased rollout: internal dogfood → beta (10% traffic) → general availability with monitoring guardrails.
5. Conduct post-launch review, capture KPIs, and feed learnings into backlog refinement.

## Milestones & Deliverables
1. **Week 4:** Design system signed off; compliance checklist approved; infrastructure provisioned.
2. **Week 8:** Core Flutter navigation and shared services complete; escrow MVP ready for sandbox testing; live feed backend ready.
3. **Week 12:** Web/mobile UI overhaul feature complete; project management, auto-assign, and ATS pipelines integrated; Cloudflare R2 live.
4. **Week 14:** System integration tests green; dispute workflow validated; marketing collateral drafted.
5. **Week 16:** FCA sign-off received; app store builds submitted; production rollout executed with monitoring and support playbooks.
