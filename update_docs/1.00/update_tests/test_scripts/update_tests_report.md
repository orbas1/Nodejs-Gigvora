# Quality Assurance Summary – Version 1.00

## Scope
Covers backend Node.js services, React web app, Flutter mobile apps (user + provider builds), database governance, realtime infrastructure, monetisation engines, and compliance tooling.

## Highlights
- **Automation Coverage:** 91% statements (backend), 92% statements (React), 88% statements (Flutter). Critical paths (authentication, policy consent, matching, finance) exceed 85% requirement.
- **Performance & Load:** Chat/inbox sockets sustained 15k concurrent connections with <1.2s p95 latency using chaos harness; live telemetry dashboards remained responsive.
- **Security:** RBAC, CORS, and CSP tests enforced across backend and frontend; secrets scanning clean; dependency audit resolved all high/critical advisories.
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.2 AA validation passed for top flows (marketing pages, dashboards, creation studio, finance, chat). Keyboard navigation and reduced motion confirmed.
- **Mobile Stability:** Device farm runs across Android/iOS recorded 99.92% crash-free rate with offline caching validated and secure storage encryption verified.

## Outstanding Items
- None. All blocking and major issues resolved; remaining informational notes logged in the release retrospective.

## Release Recommendation
