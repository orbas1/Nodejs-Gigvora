# Front-End Test Results â€“ Communication & Engagement Suite

- **Environment:** React 18 + Vite, Node 20.x.
- **Status:** Automated unit/integration test suite not yet executed for this drop. Manual exploratory testing covered chat bubble interactions (inbox search, composer modal, support escalation), feed reactions/comments/sharing, and Trust Center release/refund flows across Chrome, Safari, and Firefox.
- **Next Actions:**
  - Wire up Jest + React Testing Library coverage for `useMessagingCenter`, `ChatBubble`, and `FeedPage` optimistic updates.
  - Add Cypress smoke path verifying chat bubble launch, message post, feed reaction toggles, and Trust Center release success banner against staging APIs.
  - Integrate visual regression (Percy) for the floating chat bubble states, Trust Center KPI tiles, and feed comment drawer.
