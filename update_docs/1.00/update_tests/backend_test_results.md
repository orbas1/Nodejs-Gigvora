# Backend Test Results â€“ Communication, Engagement & Trust Suites

- **Environment:** Node 20.x, SQLite-backed Sequelize with Jest runner (`npm test -- --runInBand`).
- **Date:** 2024-08-09
- **Outcome:** 7 suites / 12 tests passed in 14.3s via `npm test -- --runInBand`. Coverage now includes escrow lifecycle maths, dispute evidence handling, and trust overview aggregates in addition to the feed/messaging regressions.
- **Notable Assertions:**
  - Trust service ensures escrow initiation updates account balances, releases/refunds zero out pending totals, and disputes mark transactions as disputed/refunded with audit trails.
  - Evidence uploads invoke the Cloudflare R2 client with prefixed keys and feed the dispute event metadata before status transitions.
  - Trust overview API aggregates release ageing buckets, dispute workload, and active account balances without duplications.
- **Regression Guardrails:** Feed and messaging suites continue to run, protecting reaction/comment flows and support escalations alongside the new trust coverage.
- **Warnings:** npm emitted `Unknown env config "http-proxy"`; harmless, tracked in tooling backlog.
- **Next Actions:** Extend CI to execute autocannon load packs against escrow and dispute endpoints plus seed synthetic disputes for performance profiling.
