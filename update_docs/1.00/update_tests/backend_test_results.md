# Backend Test Results â€“ Communication, Engagement & Trust Suites

- **Environment:** Node 20.x, SQLite-backed Sequelize with Jest runner (`npm test -- --runInBand`).
- **Date:** 2024-08-31
- **Outcome:** 13 suites / 37 tests passed in 62.6s via `npm test -- --runInBand`. Profile pipeline tests now exercise sanitised skill serialisation, trust-score recomputation, reference synchronisation, cache busting, search indexing, auto-assign, launchpad, and volunteer flows end-to-end.
- **Notable Assertions:**
  - `profileService` accepts array-based skill updates from the React editor overlay, persists JSON strings into TEXT columns, and recomputes trust-score breakdown metadata in-line with Experience Launchpad/Volunteer dashboards.
  - Launchpad, search, and volunteers suites continue to rerun successfully after the profile transaction completes, confirming SQLite/Postgres schema parity and cache invalidation behaviour.
  - Availability normaliser enforces enumerated statuses and hour limits while keeping timezone/focus-area data consistent with design annotations.
- **Regression Guardrails:** Feed, messaging, trust, project management, launchpad, volunteer, and search suites all pass, providing a baseline before we expand Task 5 dashboards and employment flows.
- **Warnings:** npm still emits `Unknown env config "http-proxy"`; tracked in tooling backlog with no impact on execution.
- **Next Actions:** Layer API contract tests for the React profile editor, cover empty reference arrays, and extend sanitiser validation to campaign/contact URLs surfaced on agency/company dashboards.

- **Date:** 2024-08-09
- **Outcome:** 7 suites / 12 tests passed in 14.3s via `npm test -- --runInBand`. Coverage now includes escrow lifecycle maths, dispute evidence handling, and trust overview aggregates in addition to the feed/messaging regressions.
- **Notable Assertions:**
  - Trust service ensures escrow initiation updates account balances, releases/refunds zero out pending totals, and disputes mark transactions as disputed/refunded with audit trails.
  - Evidence uploads invoke the Cloudflare R2 client with prefixed keys and feed the dispute event metadata before status transitions.
  - Trust overview API aggregates release ageing buckets, dispute workload, and active account balances without duplications.
- **Regression Guardrails:** Feed and messaging suites continue to run, protecting reaction/comment flows and support escalations alongside the new trust coverage.
- **Warnings:** npm emitted `Unknown env config "http-proxy"`; harmless, tracked in tooling backlog.
- **Next Actions:** Extend CI to execute autocannon load packs against escrow and dispute endpoints plus seed synthetic disputes for performance profiling.
