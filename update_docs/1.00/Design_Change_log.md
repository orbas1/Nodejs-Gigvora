# Version 1.00 Design Change Log

## Executive Summary
Version 1.00 introduces a coordinated redesign spanning the Gigvora mobile applications, responsive web experience, and provider dashboards. The refresh replaces the interim blue theme with a fully tokenised system that supports seasonal and partnership “emo” themes, restructures page templates to use composable partials, and formalises compliance, accessibility, and localisation guardrails. These changes were synthesised from the Application Design Update Plan and the Web Application Design Update artefacts and have been validated with product, engineering, compliance, and marketing stakeholders.

## Highlighted Shifts
- **Modular layout strategy** enabling hero, testimonial, and catalogue partials to be swapped per campaign without new deploys.
- **Dual-theme enablement** with base (Gigvora Blue) and expressive (Creator Pulse) palettes available across app, web, and provider tools via shared design tokens.
- **Navigation convergence** aligning mobile tab bars, provider sidebars, and desktop mega-navigation to a common information architecture.
- **Experience-specific dashboards** for Experience Launchpad, Volunteers hub, and monetisation suites using the new component grammar.
- **Golden pipeline enforcement** pairing GitHub Actions and Codemagic to block regressions when Flutter renders dev-signed dashboards or seasonal themes, keeping visual baselines aligned with Figma source of truth.
- **Expanded compliance surface** covering privacy states, financial disclosures, and accessibility instrumentation embedded in every template.

## Detailed Change History
| Date | Surface | Change Description | Prior State | Resulting Impact |
|------|---------|--------------------|-------------|------------------|
| 2024-05-20 | Design System | Introduced v3 design token library (colour, typography, elevation, motion, spacing) with light/dark and themed variants synced to Figma and code. | Fragmented colour styles and bespoke spacing definitions per team. | Accelerates implementation, unlocks theme switching, and reduces QA defects tied to inconsistent styling. |
| 2024-05-21 | Application Navigation | Consolidated mobile bottom navigation to Discovery, Bookings, Messages, Wallet, Profile and added adaptive floating action shortcuts. | Mixed navigation patterns between consumer and provider apps caused pathfinding confusion. | Improves task completion metrics and simplifies analytics attribution. |
| 2024-05-22 | Web Homepage | Rebuilt hero, social proof, and catalogue sections as configurable partials with theme-aware imagery slots, enabling campaign-specific homepages. | Static homepage with hard-coded layout and imagery. | Marketing can run simultaneous campaigns, improving conversion without engineering tickets. |
| 2024-05-22 | Provider Dashboards | Delivered new cards, tables, and status widgets for agencies/companies with consistent typography and spacing tokens. | Legacy dashboards with mismatched styling and limited density guidance. | Boosts data legibility and makes provider tools visually align with consumer experiences. |
| 2024-05-23 | Booking & Checkout | Redesigned booking flow stepper, inline validation, and compliance copy with responsive modals across app and web. | Multi-page flow with inconsistent messaging and error handling. | Reduces drop-off, improves compliance accuracy, and prepares for split-testing pricing layouts. |
| 2024-05-24 | Accessibility & Compliance | Added keyboard focus outlines, ARIA mappings, biometric consent copy, and localisation placeholders to master templates. | Accessibility tickets tracked separately with manual remediation. | Ensures WCAG AA alignment and audit readiness prior to QA hand-off. |
| 2024-05-24 | Imagery & Media | Established shared asset library with ratio guardrails, compression profiles, and theming overlays for hero and testimonial imagery. | Ad-hoc imagery sourcing without consistent art direction or performance budgets. | Improves visual quality, page speed, and storytelling consistency across platforms. |
| 2024-05-27 | Design System | Shipped Flutter-ready JSON token exports with runtime loader wiring Gigvora Blue theme into the mobile monorepo alongside DI-managed foundation package. | Tokens only referenced in design files with manual hand-off to engineering. | Accelerates implementation, guarantees parity with React tokens, and unlocks runtime theming without duplicate styling logic. |
| 2024-07-08 | Design Ops & Telemetry | Provisioned authenticated session wiring and telemetry data feeds in Flutter foundation so analytics dashboards receive realtime mobile metrics (network, GraphQL, realtime). | Dashboard concepts lacked live mobile data making monitoring mocks theoretical. | Enables design of telemetry dashboards grounded in production data, unlocking UI validation for ops monitoring and incident workflows. |
| 2024-07-01 | Mobile Messaging & Ads | Finalised offline chat overlay, live feed composer, marketplace engagement surfaces, and in-app ads console specs with motion, offline, and accessibility annotations. | High-fidelity chat/feed/ads concepts lacked offline states, biometric escalation copy, and analytics hooks. | Unlocks production build of core engagement modules with parity-ready specs for engineering, QA, and compliance reviews. |
| 2024-07-08 | Mobile Profile & Feed | Reworked profile detail layout with data-driven cards, metrics, and availability banners; added feed real-time status indicators and design tokens for feature-flag messaging. | Static profile placeholders and feed alerts lacked parity with responsive design system or instrumentation callouts. | Aligns mobile visuals with updated component grammar, exposes analytics hooks, and communicates streaming state to users. |
| 2024-08-02 | Communication Suite | Updated chat bubble overlays, feed engagement micro-interactions, and support escalation UI specs to mirror shipped React components with analytics states and accessibility copy. | Earlier concepts lacked viewer-state handling, share confirmation messaging, and support escalation checkpoints. | Keeps engineering, QA, and compliance aligned with production behaviour and analytics instrumentation. |
| 2024-08-08 | Trust & Compliance | Designed the Trust Center operations dashboard including escrow KPI tiles, release queue tables, dispute cards, and Cloudflare R2 evidence messaging aligned to the blue theme. | Operations oversight relied on spreadsheets without a unified design baseline. | Enables finance/compliance teams to monitor trust signals with production-ready UI specs feeding the new React implementation. |
| 2024-08-09 | Trust & Compliance | Finalised Trust Center parity review with operations runbook linkage, KPI thresholds, and signed URL evidence messaging for finance/legal sign-off. | Draft specs required manual reconciliation between UI states and operations procedures. | Locks programme trackers to launch-ready status, ensuring UI copy, analytics tags, and compliance workflows mirror the live backend implementation. |
| 2024-08-15 | Discovery & Search | Connected discovery UI specs to live Meilisearch indexes, documenting freshness scoring, remote role badges, and synonym-driven chip filters for launchpad/volunteer cards. | Search boards relied on placeholder data with no contract to backend scoring or filtering rules. | Enables design QA to validate explorer interactions against production data behaviour and informs chip, badge, and result density decisions for web and mobile. |
| 2024-08-21 | Discovery & Search | Finalised explorer layouts covering geo map overlays, facet drawers, saved search modals, and notification toggles matched to the new React implementation and search subscription API contracts. | Wireframes lacked production-ready map interaction specs, alert toggles, and analytics annotations for saved searches. | Unlocks engineering handoff with precise breakpoints, accessibility copy, and analytics tags across list/map modes while ensuring parity with Flutter explorer patterns. |
| 2024-07-11 | Messaging & Support | Finalised multi-thread inbox overlays, support escalation timelines, and controller-friendly payload specs including escalation badges, agent assignment chips, and resolution storytelling states. | Messaging boards covered baseline chat only without support journey artefacts or REST-ready annotations. | Unlocks engineering of support-case aware inbox flows, ensures parity between backend payloads and UI states, and provides compliance copy for escalation SLAs. |
