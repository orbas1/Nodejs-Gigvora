- **Lifecycle management:** Document data pipelines for training/updating internal models, define governance on when to retrain, and establish automated evaluation harnesses to prevent regressions.
- **Logic flows:**
  - **Model Update Flow:** Data snapshot generated ➜ feature engineering script runs ➜ compact model trained on internal hardware ➜ version stored in model registry ➜ deployment script updates services ➜ smoke test + rollback toggle ready.
  - **Inference Flow:** Request enters service ➜ features assembled ➜ internal model or heuristic applied ➜ explanation metadata generated ➜ decision returned with logging for analytics.

## Compliance, Policy & Content Deliverables
- Produce UK-compliant Terms (4–5k words), Privacy Policy (3–5k words), Refund Policy (2.5–5k words), About Us (500 words), Community Guidelines (5k words), FAQ (500–1k words). Ensure these are accessible via navigation and mobile views.

## Success Criteria
- All acceptance criteria covered by automated + manual tests.
- Release automation executing without errors; rollback verified.
- Dashboards and mobile apps demonstrate full CRUD parity and financial integration.
