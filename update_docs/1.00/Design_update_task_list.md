# Version 1.00 Design Update – Task List

## Task 1 – Discovery & Alignment (20% Complete)
- **Subtask 1.1:** Consolidate research from mobile, web, provider, Experience Launchpad, and Volunteers interviews into a unified insight report.
- **Subtask 1.2:** Map end-to-end journeys and service blueprints highlighting breakpoints where theme or content variations are required.

- **Subtask 1.4:** Produce measurement framework covering success metrics, analytics tags, and qualitative study cadence. **Status: 80% – Secure session telemetry now streams mobile metrics into analytics, unlocking dashboard data for tagging guides; pending stakeholder workshop to finalise qualitative cadence.**
- **Subtask 1.5:** Document risks, assumptions, and dependencies for sign-off in the design steering committee.

## Task 2 – Design System & Tokenisation (32% Complete)
- **Subtask 2.1:** Audit existing Figma libraries and React/Flutter implementations to identify inconsistencies and deprecate legacy assets.
- **Subtask 2.2:** Define base, semantic, and component-level tokens for colour, typography, elevation, spacing, shadows, motion, and radii.
- **Subtask 2.3:** Build variant-ready component set (buttons, forms, cards, tables, chips, banners, badges) with state documentation and accessibility notes.
- **Subtask 2.4:** Configure automated token exports (JSON/TypeScript) and publish integration guides for engineering teams.
  - **Status:** 100% – Flutter monorepo now consumes JSON exports via the new design-system package and documented loader.
- **Subtask 2.5:** Prototype seasonal emo themes (Creator Pulse, Studio Noir) and validate them through contrast testing and brand review.
- **Subtask 2.6:** Create imagery and iconography guidelines including compression budgets and theming overlays.

## Task 3 – Mobile Application Experience Redesign (50% Complete)
- **Subtask 3.1:** Produce high-fidelity designs for navigation shell, discovery feed, booking flow, Launchpad, Volunteers, wallet, and messaging modules. **Status: 95% – Messaging overlay, support escalation timelines, live feed composer, marketplace engagement, auto-assign queue, and ads console are now documented with multi-state boards tied to backend payload contracts; refreshed profile detail canvas and live feed streaming banners signed off, wallet refinements remain.**
- **Subtask 3.2:** Define interaction specs for motion, gestures, and haptics across the redesigned flows, including idle-state interventions. **Status: 68% – Motion annotations now cover chat bubble expansion, optimistic feed sends, Trust Center release confirmations, auto-assign countdown pulses, and campaign composer success; haptic ramps pending for wallet and booking.**
- **Subtask 3.3:** Annotate compliance, privacy, and biometric consent copy across relevant screens with localisation placeholders. **Status: 70% – Chat, feed, and ads flows now include offline disclosures, biometric escalation copy, escalation SLA messaging, and localisation notes; volunteer waivers scheduled next sprint.**
- **Subtask 3.4:** Create asset kits (icons, illustrations, overlays) sized for Flutter and provider mobile builds. **Status: 70% – Delivered vector icon updates for chat states, release success, dispute stages, auto-assign score tiers, and offline badges; volunteer illustrations and wallet glyphs still in progress.**
- **Subtask 3.5:** Run moderated usability testing with segmented participants (new talent, returning clients, agencies) and capture iteration backlog. **Status: 50% – Remote tests covering chat overlay, escalation timelines, live feed composer, and Trust Center review completed; follow-up sessions for ads budgeting and volunteer commitments booked.**

## Task 4 – Web Experience Redesign (65% Complete)
- **Subtask 4.1:** Recompose homepage, marketing landing pages, and knowledge base using the new partial template system. **Status: 82% – Explorer templates now cover geo map overlays, saved-search modals, and facet drawers mapped to Meilisearch contracts alongside freshness scoring, remote-role badges, and synonym-driven filters layered onto chat, help centre, and trust partials.**
- **Subtask 4.2:** Redesign booking configurator, checkout, account settings, and support flows with responsive breakpoints and compliance copy. **Status: 55% – Account support flows now incorporate escalation timelines, unread indicators, priority badges, and Trust Center linkage copy aligned to the new backend payloads; checkout and wallet states follow next.**
- **Subtask 4.3:** Deliver updated provider dashboards (agencies, companies, monetisation, analytics) with density-specific guidelines. **Status: 78% – Trust Center operations dashboard documented with KPI tiles, dispute cards, R2 evidence messaging, and signed-off React parity notes; auto-assign hub (KPI cards, queue table, override modal, decline feedback loop) now specced, with agency/company analytics boards following next sprint.**
- **Subtask 4.4:** Implement theming and theme-switch behaviour across React components, including hero, testimonial, and CTA partials.
- **Subtask 4.5:** Create CMS-ready content models for dynamic testimonials, hero modules, and campaign imagery with documentation for marketing teams.

## Task 5 – Quality, Compliance & Accessibility (18% Complete)
- **Subtask 5.1:** Build design QA checklist covering tokens, theme switching, accessibility, localisation, and data integrity.
- **Status: 55% – CI golden and integration gates now mirror the checklist, with coverage feeding QA dashboards; remaining work formalises accessibility sign-off scripts.**
- **Subtask 5.2:** Coordinate WCAG 2.2 AA audit, capture remediation tickets, and verify fixes within design files.
- **Subtask 5.3:** Partner with compliance to embed FCA, GDPR, PCI, and security disclosures into relevant templates and copy decks.
- **Subtask 5.4:** Define non-functional requirements for performance (asset budgets, skeleton states) and error handling across platforms.
- **Subtask 5.5:** Validate content governance model including translation workflows and content staging approvals.

## Task 6 – Handoff & Implementation Support (9% Complete)
- **Subtask 6.1:** Prepare implementation specs (Zeplin/Figma dev mode annotations, interaction videos, token references) for Flutter, React, and provider teams.
- **Subtask 6.2:** Host component clinics and onboarding sessions for engineering, QA, and marketing stakeholders.
- **Subtask 6.3:** Establish feedback loop for build reviews, ensuring design intent is maintained during implementation sprints.
- **Subtask 6.4:** Assemble launch toolkit with release notes, theme usage guide, content playbooks, and analytics dashboards.
- **Subtask 6.5:** Monitor beta rollout metrics and capture post-launch iteration backlog for Version 1.01 planning.
