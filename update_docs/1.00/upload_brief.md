# Upload Brief â€“ Version 1.00 Release Package

## Release Summary
Version 1.00 introduces a full-stack refresh: hardened backend bootstrap, MySQL governance, redesigned web/mobile experiences, realtime community infrastructure, monetisation engines, and cross-platform QA artefacts. All deliverables are production-ready and documented for stakeholder review.

## Included Artefacts
- **Source Code:** Latest `main` branch of backend, frontend, Flutter apps, and shared contracts with version tags.
- **Infrastructure Scripts:** Deployment automation, configuration templates, and health/telemetry dashboards.
- **Design Assets:** Figma exports, design token catalogue, and accessibility annotations for new components.
- **QA Evidence:** Automated test reports, coverage summaries, device farm screenshots, and load test metrics.
- **Documentation:** Updated change log, task list, milestone list, progress tracker, end-of-update report, policy pages, and compliance runbooks.

## Deployment Checklist
1. Provision staging/prod infrastructure with validated environment variables (no wildcard CORS, RBAC scopes enforced).
2. Run database migration bundle followed by seed and verification scripts (`npm run db:migrate`, `npm run db:seed`, `npm run db:verify`).
3. Execute build/test automation (`update_tests/test_scripts/build_test.sh`, `backend_test_script.md` steps, front-end/mobile scripts).
4. Deploy backend, web, and mobile builds via CI pipelines; monitor health dashboards for 30 minutes.
5. Publish policy updates, knowledge base articles, and support macros aligned with the new Timeline branding.

## Rollback Plan
- Maintain last known good container images and database snapshots.
- Use `npm run db:rollback` with timestamped migration to revert if critical issues surface.
- Disable realtime namespaces and monetisation toggles via feature flags while rollback executes.
