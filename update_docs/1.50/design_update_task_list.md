# Version 1.50 Design Task List

## Task 1 – Token Library Consolidation (25% complete)
**Objective:** Deliver a single source of truth for color, typography, spacing, and motion tokens across platforms.

**Subtasks:**
1. Inventory legacy tokens from mobile and web libraries, identifying duplicates and conflicts.
2. Define final color ramps with accessibility contrast ratios and semantic naming conventions.
3. Map typography scale, weights, and line-height rules for headings, body, and UI labels.
4. Publish token package to shared repository (JSON/Flutter/SCSS exports) with documentation.
5. Conduct design-engineering review and adjust based on implementation feedback.

## Task 2 – Navigation & IA Alignment (15% complete)
**Objective:** Rebuild navigation structures ensuring cross-platform parity and persona-specific entry points.

**Subtasks:**
1. Analyse current IA pain points through heuristic review and stakeholder interviews.
2. Produce updated sitemap and user/provider journey flows covering dashboard, projects, messaging, and compliance.
3. Design navigation components (tab bars, drawers, header menus) with responsive states.
4. Validate IA via moderated tree tests and document findings.
5. Deliver annotated navigation specs to engineering with fallback behaviours for edge cases.

## Task 3 – Core Surface Redesign (10% complete)
**Objective:** Refresh high-impact screens (dashboards, chat, feed, financial workflows) to align with Version 1.50 capabilities.

**Subtasks:**
1. Draft wireframes incorporating new data modules, KPIs, and action shortcuts grounded in the curated seed dataset states (applications, messaging, notifications, provider workspaces).
2. Translate wireframes into high-fidelity designs with componentized cards, charts, and overlays.
3. Define chat and feed interaction states (online/offline, unread, moderation, error) and annotate transitions, including cache-aware refresh patterns surfaced by the new messaging/notification services.
4. Document financial workflow visuals (escrow progress, trust scores, disputes) with compliance copy.
5. Review surfaces with product/compliance stakeholders and capture approval notes.

**Progress Update:** Schema overview, ER diagram, and governance pack are published to keep redesign decisions aligned with sanitised payloads, retention requirements, and automated QA coverage.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/docs/schema-overview.md†L3-L52】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/docs/er-diagram.md†L1-L33】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/docs/data-governance.md†L3-L25】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/tests/applicationService.test.js†L1-L84】

## Task 4 – Accessibility & Compliance Readiness (0% complete)
**Objective:** Ensure all redesigned assets meet WCAG 2.1 AA and regulatory standards.

**Subtasks:**
1. Run automated color and contrast audits on updated components and flag remediation tasks.
2. Conduct screen-reader and keyboard navigation testing across critical flows.
3. Verify compliance messaging, disclosures, and trust indicators against FCA guidance.
4. Create accessibility acceptance criteria per epic and embed into QA checklist.
5. Provide remediation recommendations and track closure in the design QA log.

## Task 5 – Prototype & Usability Validation (0% complete)
**Objective:** Validate usability, comprehension, and perceived trust through structured testing.

**Subtasks:**
1. Build interactive prototypes for user and provider journeys (project creation, messaging, escrow release).
2. Recruit representative participants and execute moderated usability sessions.
3. Synthesize findings into prioritised issue lists with severity ratings.
4. Iterate designs to address high/medium issues and document rationale.
5. Share final usability report with stakeholders and log decisions in change log.

## Task 6 – Implementation Support & QA (0% complete)
**Objective:** Guide engineering through build-out and ensure design fidelity prior to release.

**Subtasks:**
1. Provide redlines, assets, and component specifications within engineering handoff tools.
2. Participate in design QA sessions, logging deviations and required fixes.
3. Coordinate with QA to run visual regression and accessibility checks on staging builds.
4. Approve or document exceptions for any deviations from design specs.
5. Update `Design_Change_log.md` and `design_update_progress_tracker.md` with final status and lessons learned.
