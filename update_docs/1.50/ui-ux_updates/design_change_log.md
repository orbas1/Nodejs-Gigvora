# Version 1.50 â€“ UI/UX Design Change Log

## Release Context
Version 1.50 is the first production-grade design system pass that unifies the Gigvora phone, web, and admin experiences. The UI/UX updates prioritise:
- Parity between the rebuilt Flutter phone app, refreshed marketing site, and desktop dashboards.
- A blue-forward visual identity that scales from light marketing moments to dense operational tooling.
- Trust-by-design patterns that surface escrow states, dispute health, and compliance indicators without sacrificing usability.

## Major Design Decisions
1. **Component System Refresh**
   - Introduced a design token library covering colour roles, typography ramp, spacing, radii, and elevation to be consumed by Flutter, React, and web CMS teams.
   - Replaced legacy card, chip, and banner components with responsive variants that adapt to phone breakpoints.
   - Standardised iconography around a 24px grid with duotone treatment for primary actions and outline treatment for secondary.

2. **Screen Architecture Overhaul**
   - Re-mapped all phone screens into four navigation stacks (Onboarding, Marketplace, Work Management, Profile/Settings) and aligned menu depth with discoverability priorities.
   - Added context-sensitive hubs (Live Feed, Launchpad, Volunteer, Ads) that reuse shared layout scaffolding for faster iteration.
   - Embedded status rails across job, project, and escrow flows to surface progression checkpoints.

3. **Trust, Compliance, and Financial Transparency**
   - Elevated FCA-compliant escrow messaging into persistent banners, inline tooltips, and modal confirmations across payment-related screens.
   - Added dispute stage visualization, audit log preview drawers, and explicit consent capture during onboarding.
   - Ensured all financial actions are accompanied by dual-tone buttons, microcopy, and fallback contact options.

4. **Communication Layer Integration**
   - Introduced the floating omnichannel chat bubble with conversation previews, SLA timers, and escalation tags.
   - Threaded discussions, quick actions (approve milestone, accept offer), and AI-suggested replies are surfaced via contextual menus.
   - Notification centre redesigned with grouped delivery (projects, jobs, chat, platform) and persistent CTA chips.

5. **Discovery & Engagement**
   - Live feed cards now support video, gallery, poll, and link attachments with analytics overlays for creators.
   - Global search exposes saved searches, quick filters, and cross-entity results with icon-coded tabs.
   - Recommendation surfaces (Suggested gigs, Suggested talent, Launchpad matches) now share skeleton states and empty-state education blocks.

## Accessibility & Performance Initiatives
- Achieved minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratios for text against primary and secondary backgrounds.
- Increased tap target size to 48px with responsive padding to reduce accidental input on smaller phones.
- Implemented skeleton loading, shimmer placeholders, and asynchronous list virtualization for large feeds.

## Dependencies & Follow-Up Tasks
- Token library delivery is coordinated with the design system squad to publish a Figma styles package and Flutter theme extension.
- Visual regression test baselines to be updated once production components land in the build pipeline.
- Continued usability testing scheduled for agencies, companies, and volunteer personas post-beta.
