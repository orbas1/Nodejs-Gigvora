# Version 1.50 UI/UX Design Change Log

## Release Context
- **Release Window:** 18 April – 27 May 2024 with progressive rollouts to staging, pilot customers, and general availability.
- **Design Drivers:** Align the provider command center, consumer discovery experiences, and public marketing site around a unified design language while removing friction identified in Q1 journey-mapping workshops.
- **Research Inputs:** 42 moderated usability sessions, 318 in-product survey responses, telemetry from 1.2M sessions, and accessibility audits conducted with two external consultants.
- **Success Metrics:** +12% increase in successful gig bookings, -18% reduction in provider onboarding abandonment, WCAG 2.1 AA compliance across high-traffic flows, and 95th percentile page load below 3.2s on mid-tier hardware.

## 14 Apr 2024 — Runtime Documentation CTA
- Added a spec download action to the admin runtime panel blueprint referencing `/api/docs/runtime-security`, including tooltip messaging, empty/error states, and localisation keys recorded in `Screen_text.md`.
- Updated `Dashboard Designs.md` and `component_functions.md` so the documentation CTA appears alongside connection pool gauges and perimeter analytics, ensuring operators can export the contract without leaving the dashboard.
- Logged QA scenarios for the documentation CTA (success, 404, stale cache) in `Design_update_task_list.md` and `Design_update_progress_tracker.md` to align with engineering test plans.

## 18 Apr 2024 — WAF Auto-Block Telemetry
- Extended admin runtime panel specs with auto-quarantine list states, countdown badges, and review guidance in `Dashboard Designs.md`, `Screens_Updates_widget_functions.md`, and `Screens_update_images_and_vectors.md` so operators understand when the system blocks repeat offenders automatically.
- Updated `Screen_text.md` and localisation worksheets with escalation copy, support prompts, and SOC annotations tied to the new `waf.autoBlock` schema, ensuring messaging aligns across web, Flutter, and incident runbooks.
- Added Flutter snackbar visuals and interaction notes in `App_screens_drawings.md` detailing auto-block alert tone, action buttons, and accessible announcements for mobile operators.

## 17 Apr 2024 — Web Application Firewall Telemetry
- Finalised admin runtime panel specs for the WAF card, documenting zero-data, elevated, and incident states with bindings to `/api/admin/runtime/health.waf` metrics in `Dashboard Designs.md` and `Screens_Updates_widget_functions.md`.
- Added SOC-focused copy, icon treatments, and reference links to `Screen_text.md` and `Design Plan.md` so operations teams can escalate suspicious activity from the UI.
- Updated Flutter bootstrap illustrations and snackbar notes in `App_screens_drawings.md` to reflect the new security telemetry and localisation tokens.

## 10 Apr 2024 — Maintenance Communications Rollout
- Finalised cross-surface maintenance banner treatments (web top-of-shell, mobile drawer, provider command center strip) with severity-driven color tokens, iconography, and dismissal logic. Specifications captured in `web_application_styling_changes.md`, `user_application_styling_changes.md`, and `provider_application_styling_changes.md` now align with the runtime maintenance API contract.
- Added admin maintenance registry table, modal editor, and lifecycle toast guidance to `web_app_wireframe_changes.md` and `component_functions.md`, including form validation messaging, actor audit chips, and schedule conflict warnings.
- Documented mobile maintenance polling cadence, offline fallback copy, and CTA behaviours in `user_app_wireframe_changes.md` and `user_application_logic_flow_changes.md` so Flutter teams can mirror backend lifecycles.
- Logged accessibility requirements (aria-live alerts, focus traps, keyboard shortcuts) and analytics events for maintenance interactions in `web_application_logic_flow_changes.md` and `Design_update_task_list.md` Task 9 commentary, ensuring QA scripts cover downtime drills.

## Global Design Foundations
### Visual Language
1. **Token Refresh:** Migrated to the Gigvora Indigo palette (primary `#3730A3`, accent `#F97316`, success `#16A34A`, warning `#F59E0B`, error `#EF4444`) with semantic aliasing for backgrounds, surfaces, and outlines.
2. **Typography:** Introduced a dual-type system (`Space Grotesk` headings, `Inter` body) with optical sizing adjustments for 14px–48px range, letter-spacing tuning for readability, and fallback stacks for Android/iOS/web.
3. **Spacing & Layout:** Standardised on an 8pt spacing scale with nested ratios (8/12/16/24/32/48) and codified container widths for XS through XXL breakpoints.
4. **Iconography:** Rebuilt the icon library with 2px stroke weight, matching corner radii, and two-tone support for dark mode; exported as SVG sprites and Lottie micro-interactions.

### Interaction Principles
- **Motion Guidelines:** 200ms ease-in-out for modals, 120ms ease-out for hover reveals, 160ms ease-in for dismissals, orchestrated via Framer Motion tokens to maintain parity across platforms.
- **State Hierarchy:** Every interactive component now exposes rest, hover, focus, active, loading, and disabled visuals with explicit design specs and accessible text equivalents.
- **Input Feedback:** Inline validation is instant on blur, while destructive actions use confirmation banners with undo; long-running tasks surface progress bars with estimated durations.

### Accessibility Enhancements
- Raised minimum tap targets to 48×48px on touch surfaces and 44×44px on desktop.
- Ensured all icon-only actions include `aria-label` or visible tooltips.
- Added high-contrast themes with a 7:1 ratio for text on primary backgrounds.
- Documented focus order, skip links, and keyboard shortcuts in design specs.

## Platform-Specific Highlights
### Web Application (Marketing & Responsive Hub)
- **Landing Hero Revamp:** Split hero layout with responsive headline scaling, animated skill cloud, and measurable CTA prominence (primary "Find Talent", secondary "Hire with Concierge").
- **Navigation & Information Architecture:** Persistent top bar with mega-menu for solutions, industries, resources; contextual breadcrumbs on subpages; sticky help launcher with dark/light parity.
- **Authenticated Header Realignment:** After authentication the header now sequences **Feed → Explore → Create → Dashboard → Profile** with the avatar exposing an expanded management drop-down (account, finance, admin, agency, company, and logout links). Feed defaults to personalised activity, Explore surfaces marketplace discovery, Create opens the multi-surface publishing drawer, and Dashboard routes to the role-aware control centre.
- **Content Modules:** Reauthored testimonial carousel with avatars, role metadata, and NPS scores; introduced interactive pricing tiers with feature toggles and billing frequency switcher.
- **Performance Optimisations:** Deferred non-critical animations, inlined SVGs under 2KB, preloaded hero illustration, and compressed background video to <2.5MB using VP9.
- **Compliance Elements:** Added cookie consent redesign with clear opt-in/out, surfaced trust badges, and updated footer legal links for SOC2 Type II attestation.

### Provider Application (Operations Portal)
- **Command Center Dashboard:** Modular overview containing gig pipeline funnel, SLA heatmap, payout schedule timeline, and alert stack with severity tags; supports inline filtering by region/team.
- **Queue & Case Management:** Redesigned list with density switcher (comfortable/compact), column personalization, and quick bulk actions (assign, escalate, snooze).
- **Onboarding & Verification:** Drawer-based multi-step flows with contextual guidance, document preview thumbnails, and real-time validation for identity + compliance uploads.
- **Scheduling & Availability:** Calendar updated with drag-to-adjust shifts, conflict resolution prompts, and automated capacity recommendations derived from forecast API.
- **Collaboration Aids:** Introduced team notes side panel, @mentions in comments, and SLA timers on service detail pages for proactive follow-up.

### User Mobile Application (Consumer & Talent App)
- **Navigation System:** Five-tab bottom navigation (Discover, Saved, Messages, Bookings, Profile) with floating action button for quick gig posting; haptic feedback tuned for key interactions.
- **Discover Flow:** Personalized feed cards featuring hero imagery, distance chips, rating badges, and price range toggles; infinite scroll replaced with segmented sections for curated lists.
- **Gig Creation Wizard:** Four-step wizard with progress indicator, inline budget calculator, recommended template selection, and contextual tips from knowledge base.
- **Messaging & Notifications:** Threaded conversation view with read receipts, quick replies, and availability share cards; consolidated notification settings under Profile > Preferences.
- **Profile & Reputation:** Enhanced profile layout highlighting badges, certifications, upcoming engagements timeline, and social proof modules; added action to request endorsements.

### Experience Expansions Across Panels & Studios
- **Purchase Journeys:** Introduced dedicated pricing overview, checkout wizard, invoice history, and receipt confirmation modules that align with finance compliance requirements and feed analytics to revenue dashboards.
- **Role-Based Panels:** Delivered deep navigation and dashboards for Admin, User, Freelancer, Company, Agency, Headhunter, Mentorship, and Creation Studio personas, each with tailored widgets, shortcuts, and cross-surface notifications.
- **Community & Growth Modules:** Added Networking and Speed Networking rooms, Mentoring lounge, Experience Launchpad onboarding, and Volunteering catalog with searchable listings and availability management.
- **Operational Suites:** Formalised Project Management, Gig Management, Job Listing, Interview Management, Interview Room, Agency HR & Operations, Company Management, Budget Management, and Messaging/Inbox/Chat Bubble ecosystems with full logic and styling parity across web and native.
- **Governance & Compliance Pages:** Expanded Account Preference settings, Finance settings, Profile page redesign, and refreshed static assets for About Us, Terms & Conditions, and Privacy Policy to reflect the new tone and component library.
