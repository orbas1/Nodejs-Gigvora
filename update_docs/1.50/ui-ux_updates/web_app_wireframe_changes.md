# Web App â€“ Wireframe Changes

## Information Architecture
- Restructured primary navigation into "Discover", "Work", "Manage", "Insights", and "Admin" with secondary ribbon for quick access to Live Feed, Launchpad, Volunteer Hub, and Ads Manager.
- Introduced workspace switcher and profile actions within the header for consistent cross-platform behaviour.

## Homepage & Marketing
- Hero section now features animated gig carousel, trust metrics, and CTA buttons for talent and clients.
- Added modular testimonial, product highlight, and integration showcase blocks that can be re-ordered via CMS.

## Dashboard Experiences
- Unified dashboard template provides metric tiles, tabular summaries, and contextual insights cards.
- Embedded compliance panel summarising escrow health, dispute counts, and audit reminders.

## Workflows
- Project management wireframes mirror phone layout with additional desktop affordances (drag-and-drop, multi-select, keyboard shortcuts).
- Jobs board includes split view (list + detail) enabling recruiters to triage applications rapidly.
- Ads manager integrates campaign calendar view and performance breakdown charts.

## Communication
- Persistent right-side panel for chat and notifications, allowing multi-tasking without leaving current context.
- Support centre revamp introduces searchable knowledge base, ticket submission wizard, and SLA status tracker.

## Accessibility & Responsiveness
- Breakpoints tuned for 1440, 1280, 1024, and 768 widths, ensuring parity with phone design tokens.
- High-contrast and reduced motion toggles accessible from footer.

## Documentation Alignment
- Reference `Web Application Design Update/` for component-level specs, copy decks, and asset requirements to maintain fidelity between wireframes and implementation.
