# Provider (Agency & Company) App â€“ Wireframe Changes

## Navigation Structure
- **Global Drawer Simplification:** Consolidated fragmented tabs into a three-tier layout (Overview, Workstreams, Administration) with contextual quick links pinned to the top for urgent actions (approve timesheets, review disputes, release escrow).
- **Workspace Switcher:** Added a persistent dropdown in the app bar allowing agency managers to swap between internal teams, subsidiaries, or client-facing workspaces without leaving the current context.
- **Role-Aware Shortcuts:** Wireframes now display dynamic shortcut chips on the dashboard depending on the logged-in provider persona (agency admin, HR manager, finance lead).

## Dashboard Enhancements
- **Performance Summary Cards:** Replaced static stat blocks with horizontally scrollable cards featuring sparkline trends, variance badges, and CTA footers ("Open analytics", "Adjust budgets").
- **Escrow & Invoice Timeline:** Introduced a dual-column component showing upcoming releases, pending approvals, and flagged disputes with colour-coded urgency indicators.
- **Live Feed Digest:** Embedded a condensed feed of mentions, assigned tasks, and Launchpad matches tailored to provider teams.

## Workstream Screens
- **Project Management Board:** Rebuilt as a Kanban-first view with swimlanes for lifecycle states (Scoping, Active, Awaiting Client, Escalated). Cards expose quick actions (assign talent, open chat, adjust milestones) via hover/tap menu.
- **Talent Bench:** Added filters for availability, trust score, Launchpad status, and internal rating. Wireframes highlight side-by-side comparison drawers for shortlist decisions.
- **Jobs & Campaigns:** Combined job board and ads manager into a segmented control surface; each segment reveals cards with progress rings, budget burn, and recommended optimisation tips.

## Collaboration & Communication
- **Floating Action Panel:** The omnichannel chat bubble opens into a multi-tab drawer (Projects, Support, Internal) with message previews, SLA timers, and escalation tags.
- **Approvals Centre:** Wireframes depict a modal that aggregates approvals (milestones, contracts, expenses) with swipeable detail cards optimised for single-handed phone use.

## Onboarding & Compliance
- **Guided Setup:** Added a 5-step onboarding carousel for new providers covering verification, workspace setup, payment configuration, and Launchpad participation.
- **Audit Trail Access:** Each financial wireframe now includes an "Audit" button revealing chronological logs and downloadable reports.

## Responsive & Accessibility Considerations
- Sticky headers on long lists to preserve context.
- Quick filters anchored at the bottom for thumb reachability.
- Support for high-contrast mode and large text scaling tested within the new wireframes.
