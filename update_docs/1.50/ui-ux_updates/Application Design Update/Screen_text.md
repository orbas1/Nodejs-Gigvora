# Screen Text & Microcopy Guidelines

## Tone & Voice
- Confident, collaborative, and trustworthy. Avoid jargon; explain financial terms plainly.
- Use active voice and direct CTAs (“Review milestone”, “Complete verification”).

## Key Areas
- **Onboarding:** Provide reassuring messaging about data privacy and benefits of completing profile/trust checks. Example: “Verified profiles win 3x more work on Gigvora.”
- **Escrow & Payments:** Clearly explain status, next steps, and regulatory safeguards. Example: “Funds are safeguarded in FCA-regulated accounts until both parties approve release.”
- **Disputes:** Empathetic tone acknowledging stress, highlight support availability.
- **Launchpad Coach:** Motivational copy celebrating progress (“You’re 80% ready for auto-matching”).
- **Volunteer Hub:** Emphasise impact and community recognition.

## Error Messages
- Provide actionable guidance: “We couldn’t upload that file. Try a smaller size or different format.”
- Avoid blame; suggest next steps or support contact.

## Accessibility
- Keep headlines under 60 characters for readability.
- Support localisation by avoiding idioms; ensure placeholders accommodate longer translations.

## Trust & Compliance Messaging
- Include inline tooltips for FCA statements, linking to knowledge base articles.
- Display data usage summaries when collecting sensitive information.
