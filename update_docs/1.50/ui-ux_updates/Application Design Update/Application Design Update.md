# Application Design Update â€“ Version 1.50

## Purpose
Provide a holistic design blueprint for the Gigvora phone application as it reaches production readiness, aligning UX, visual identity, and logic with the broader marketplace transformation.

## Goals
- Deliver full parity between phone, web, and admin experiences while optimising for mobile-first usage.
- Showcase trust and compliance throughout financial interactions.
- Increase engagement via refreshed feed, discovery, and communication surfaces.
- Support new personas (agencies, companies, Launchpad participants, volunteers) with tailored journeys.

## Structure
This update is organised into the following documentation sets:
1. **Screen Updates:** Detailed breakdown of every screen, planned changes, widget strategy, and visual assets.
2. **Logic & Functional Updates:** Flow charts and descriptions covering how users move through the app.
3. **Design & Styling Updates:** Fonts, colours, spatial rules, and component styling adjustments.
4. **Data & Navigation Requirements:** Content, dummy data needs, menus, and settings architecture.
5. **Overviews & Briefs:** Strategic summary of how all pieces work together.

### Quick Reference Map
- `Screens_Update.md`, `Screens_Update_Plan.md`, and `Screens_list.md` define the screen inventory, phased rollout, and dependencies.
- `Screen_blueprints.md` renders ASCII wireframes with component IDs, spacing, and animation notes for critical flows.
- `Screens__Update_widget_types.md`, `Screens_Updates_widget_functions.md`, `Screen_buttons.md`, and `Screen_text.md` define reusable components, behaviours, and UI copy.

## Design Principles
- **Consistency:** Leverage shared design tokens and component libraries across platforms.
- **Clarity:** Make complex financial states, auto-assignment, and Launchpad readiness easy to understand at a glance.
- **Responsiveness:** Design for one-handed use, offline resilience, and accessibility compliance.
- **Scalability:** Ensure new modules (Ads, Volunteer Hub, Launchpad) can grow without redesigning foundational patterns.

## Outcomes
- A ready-to-build blueprint for engineering handoff, including screen maps, widget inventories, and interaction notes.
- Clear dependencies and data requirements to support dummy data, testing, and analytics instrumentation.
- Alignment across product, design, engineering, and compliance stakeholders ahead of the Version 1.50 release.
