# Settings Architecture

## Structure
- **Settings Home:** Summarises account status, payment verification, security, and device preferences.
- **Sections:** Notifications, Privacy, Payments, Legal & Compliance, Device Preferences, Accessibility, Language (future).

## Navigation
- Access via Profile tab shortcut, home dashboard tile, or quick settings drawer.
- Sub-sections presented as list items with icons and status indicators (e.g., “2 pending verifications”).

## Design Considerations
- Use card layout for grouped settings; avoid long scrolling lists by categorising.
- Provide inline explanations and links to knowledge base articles for complex settings (e.g., escrow permissions).
- Include search within settings for quick discovery.

## Security & Compliance
- Payments section requires biometric/MFA re-authentication for sensitive actions.
- Legal & Compliance hosts policy acknowledgements, FCA statements, and document downloads.

## Accessibility
- Accessibility section offers text scaling, high-contrast toggle, reduced motion.
- Device preferences manage push notifications, biometrics, and offline data caching.
