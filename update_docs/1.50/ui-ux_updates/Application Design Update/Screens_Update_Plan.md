# Screens Update Plan

## Objectives
- Sequence delivery of redesigned screens to align with engineering sprints and backend readiness.
- Ensure critical compliance and financial flows are validated before secondary surfaces (volunteer, ads).
- Maintain parity between phone and web designs for shared modules.

## Delivery Phases
1. **Phase 1 – Foundations (Weeks 1-2)**
   - Finalise onboarding, authentication, and settings flows.
   - Deliver tokenised components (buttons, cards, inputs, modals) and update navigation patterns.
   - Conduct accessibility audit on foundational screens.
2. **Phase 2 – Core Workflows (Weeks 3-5)**
   - Ship home dashboard variants, project workspace, jobs/gigs listings, and unified inbox.
   - Align with backend teams on escrow and dispute data handling.
   - Run usability tests with talent and client personas.
   - Deliver application review board blueprint with stage management, scoring, and analytics audit feeds to mirror new schema.
3. **Phase 3 – Engagement & Growth (Weeks 6-7)**
   - Implement live feed, post composer, recommendations hub, and Launchpad coach.
   - Integrate analytics instrumentation requirements.
   - Produce detailed ASCII blueprints for Launchpad and feed screens to lock component positioning with engineering.
4. **Phase 4 – Advanced Modules (Weeks 8-9)**
   - Deliver ads manager, volunteer hub, agency dashboards, and contest workflows.
   - Conduct compliance review for FCA messaging and audit trails.
   - Finalise blueprint docs for volunteer spotlight, dispute timeline, and analytics drill-down flows.
   - Document provider workspace directory, invite lifecycle, and compliance note screens aligned to provider tooling tables.
5. **Phase 5 – Polish & Handoff (Weeks 10-11)**
   - Visual QA, motion refinement, and localization review.
   - Prepare handoff packages for engineering with Zeplin/Figma exports, redlines, and widget annotations.

## Collaboration Requirements
- Weekly sync with backend, payments, and compliance squads.
- Shared Jira board with design tickets mapped to engineering tasks.
- Review sessions with marketing for homepage and brand alignment.

## Acceptance Criteria
- All primary flows validated through usability tests achieving 95% task success.
- Visual regression baselines created for key screens.
- Accessibility compliance sign-off (WCAG 2.1 AA) secured.
- Blueprint documentation cross-checked with implemented UI to ensure pixel parity (tolerance ±2px, spacing ±4px).
