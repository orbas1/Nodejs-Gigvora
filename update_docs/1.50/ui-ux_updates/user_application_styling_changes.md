# User App – Styling Changes

## Palette & Theming
- Core palette harmonised with Gigvora blue gradients (Azure → Sapphire) and neutral backgrounds. Volunteer and Launchpad modules receive accent tints (Teal, Purple) for quick recognition.
- Surface elevations reduce to emphasise content; cards use subtle drop shadows and soft borders for segmentation.

## Typography
- Headings use **Manrope** with 600 weight for clarity, while body copy uses **Inter** 400/500 for readability.
- Microcopy and helper text sized at 12-13px with 150% line height for accessibility.
- Numerics in analytics adopt tabular variants to align metrics.

## Component Updates
- Primary buttons adopt pill shape with gradient fill; secondary buttons outlined with 2px stroke.
- Filter chips upgraded with icon support and active-state glow for quick scanning.
- Skeleton loaders introduced for feed cards, job listings, and profile modules.

## Imagery & Iconography
- Updated avatar placeholders featuring geometric motifs representing collaboration.
- Added icon set for new modules (Launchpad, Volunteer Hub, Ads) maintaining 24px grid.

## Motion & Interaction
- Page transitions use slide-fade with 200ms duration. Feed refresh uses stretch animation tied to pull-to-refresh gestures.
- Microinteractions confirm actions such as “Apply”, “Submit”, “Save search” through colour pulses and checkmarks.

## Accessibility
- Minimum touch targets maintained at 48px; additional spacing applied to floating action button for thumb reach.
- High-contrast theme ensures gradients collapse to solid colours with sufficient contrast.
- All icons provided with descriptive labels for screen readers.
