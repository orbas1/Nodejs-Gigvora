# Web Application Logic & Flow Changes — Version 1.50

## Overview
The Version 1.50 update rationalises logged-out marketing and logged-in workspace flows to shorten time-to-value and reinforce trust. Logic diagrams were expanded to clarify branch conditions, automation triggers, and integrations across marketing funnel, trial onboarding, and analytics usage.

## Key Flow Themes
- **Guided Discovery:** Mega-menu reorganised with contextual landing pages and dynamic content based on industry selection.
- **Conversion Focus:** Demo request and trial signup flows streamlined with reduced form fields and progressive profiling.
- **Self-Service Enablement:** Logged-in dashboards expose quick actions, contextual help, and data export scheduling.
- **Governance & Security:** Admin flows integrate audit logs, permission gating, and session management checkpoints.

## Marketing Site Flows
### 1. Visitor → Demo Request
1. Visitor lands on homepage or campaign page; hero CTA instrumented with UTM metadata.
2. CTA triggers multi-step form with dynamic fields: name, email, company size, industry, use case.
3. Form validation occurs client-side; on submit, system triggers marketing automation workflow, sends confirmation email, and routes lead to CRM with scoring.
4. Success screen offers additional resources and calendar scheduling widget for immediate meeting booking.

### 2. Visitor → Self-Serve Trial
1. Landing page features prominent "Start Trial" CTA; selecting opens modal overlay.
2. Flow collects email, password, company name, region, and consent checkboxes. Password strength meter and SSO option included.
3. After submission, user directed to onboarding wizard; account flagged as trial with 14-day expiry timer.
4. Welcome email and in-app checklist triggered; marketing automation segments user into nurture track.

### 3. Content Exploration
- Mega-menu interactions fetch dynamic highlights per industry; analytics track selections.
- Resource hub filtering updates query string for sharable URLs and SEO benefits.
- Contact sales button opens chat widget with pre-populated context from page metadata.

## Logged-In Workspace Flows
### 1. Trial Onboarding Wizard
1. Step 1: Company Setup — collect organisation details, logos, brand colours; pre-populate from marketing form when available.
2. Step 2: Team Invitations — add teammates via email, assign roles (Admin, Manager, Analyst); invitation emails triggered.
3. Step 3: Service Configuration — choose templates, configure availability, import existing data via CSV/API.
4. Step 4: Go-Live Checklist — verification of compliance, payments, and communication settings.
5. Completion triggers celebratory modal, prompts to schedule onboarding call, and sets product tour status to complete.

### 2. Dashboard Interaction Flow
- Users land on overview dashboard; system checks role and personalises layout modules.
- Quick actions (create gig, invite provider, view insights) available in hero banner.
- Selecting KPI tile opens detailed analytics panel with filters and export options.
- Alerts feed surfaces tasks; clicking an alert deep-links to corresponding feature.

### 3. Admin & Permissions Flow
- Admin selects Settings → Team; sees list of members with status.
- Inviting new member opens modal with role selection, scope definition (regions, services), and optional welcome message.
- Permissions updates log to audit history, trigger notification to affected user, and update active session tokens.
- Deactivation prompts confirmation, reassign tasks, and record timestamp.

### 4. Billing & Plan Management Flow
- Billing tab displays current plan, usage metrics, and upcoming invoice preview.
- Upgrade CTA opens plan comparison drawer; selecting plan triggers payment collection and pro-rated billing logic.
- Add-ons (advanced analytics, priority support) accessible via toggles with contextual tooltips.
- Cancellation flow provides retention offers, collects reason, and schedules plan change at end of cycle.

### 5. Support & Feedback Flow
- In-app help launcher triggers search overlay; results combine knowledge base, community threads, and contact options.
- If user initiates chat, context (page, role, account tier) passed to support agent.
- Feedback submission posts to productboard integration, tagging module and sentiment.

## Automation & Integrations
- Marketing forms integrate with HubSpot; events include `demo_requested`, `trial_started`, `resource_downloaded`.
- Product telemetry flows into Segment; dashboards built in Looker monitor conversion funnel.
- Single Sign-On with SAML/OAuth ensures enterprise-grade access control; flow includes fallback for password login.
- Webhooks notify partner apps upon trial activation, invite acceptance, and plan upgrades.

## Security & Compliance Touchpoints
- All sensitive forms implement reCAPTCHA v3 scoring; suspicious traffic flagged for manual review.
- Privacy center offers data download and deletion flows with two-step verification.
- Session management allows admins to revoke sessions; idle timeout prompts after 30 minutes of inactivity.

## Testing & Optimisation
- Conducted usability tests on trial signup reducing average completion time by 42%.

- AB experiments planned for pricing layout and onboarding step order.

## Future Improvements
