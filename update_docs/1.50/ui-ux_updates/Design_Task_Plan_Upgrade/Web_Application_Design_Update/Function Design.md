# Functional Design Considerations â€” Web Application v1.50

## Critical Functions
- Lead capture (demo request, trial signup)
- Content discovery (search, filters)
- Pricing evaluation (plan comparison, toggle)
- User onboarding (trial flow, checklist)
- Support engagement (chat, contact forms)
- Analytics exploration (dashboard to detail views)

## Principles
- Minimise friction by reducing form fields and providing progressive profiling.
- Maintain context while navigating between sections using breadcrumbs and persistent filters.
- Provide clear feedback for each action with confirmations and next steps.

## Functional Patterns
- **Forms:** Autosave progress, show validation inline, integrate with CRM and marketing tools.
- **Carousels:** Provide manual controls, auto-play with pause, accessible navigation.
- **Drawers/Modals:** Use for contact forms, video previews, quick plan comparisons.
- **Analytics Drilldowns:** Preserve filter state when moving between pages; allow export.

## Error Recovery
- Offer alternative channels (chat, phone) when forms fail.
- Provide descriptive error messages and retry options.
- Log errors with correlation IDs for support.

## Testing
- Conduct user testing on trial signup and demo flows for comprehension and completion.
- Use analytics to monitor drop-off and iterate on high-friction steps.
