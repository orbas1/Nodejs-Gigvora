# Dashboard Organisation — Web Application v1.50

## Information Hierarchy
1. **Mission Control Banner** — Displays plan usage, onboarding progress, quick links to invite teammates or upgrade.
2. **Operational Metrics** — KPI tiles summarising active gigs, completion rate, revenue, satisfaction.
3. **Pipeline & Activity** — Left column with pipeline chart, activity feed, task list.
4. **Insights & Support** — Right column with recommendations, alerts, resource links.

## Layout Rules
- Keep hero banner minimal height to preserve space for actionable modules.

- Monitor task completion rates triggered from dashboard to evaluate effectiveness.

## Accessibility
