## Usage Guidelines
- Campaign palettes apply to hero backgrounds, highlight modules, and CTA bars; maintain core navigation/footer colours.
- Ensure text remains accessible by pairing with neutral surfaces or using gradient overlays.
- Limit campaign-specific colours to targeted sections to avoid brand fragmentation.

## Implementation
- Define CSS variables `campaign.primary`, `campaign.accent`, `campaign.supporting` for each theme.
- Provide toggles within CMS to switch palette per page.
- Document sample combinations in design system with accessibility notes.

## Accessibility
- Verify contrast ratios for each palette combination using automated checks.
- Provide fallback to standard palette if dynamic theming not supported by browser.

## Testing & Governance
- QA each campaign theme before launch to confirm visual integrity on major browsers.
- Maintain log of active campaigns and expiration dates to revert to base theme.
- Review campaign palettes quarterly with brand team for relevancy and consistency.
