## Content Flow Principles
- Present proof early (logos/testimonials) to build trust.
- Alternate background colours to create visual rhythm.
- Provide conversion opportunities at regular intervals (hero, mid-page, footer).

## Responsive Considerations
- Collapse columns into stacked sections on mobile with consistent spacing.
- Replace carousels with swipeable sliders for touch devices.
- Ensure CTA buttons remain above fold on small screens.

## Analytics & Testing
- Track scroll depth to gauge engagement per section.
- Run A/B tests on hero headlines and CTA placements.
- Monitor click-through on pricing cards and resource links.
