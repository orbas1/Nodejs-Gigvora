# Web Application Design Update Plan — Version 1.50

## Strategic Intent
- Modernise the Gigvora marketing and responsive web experience to improve conversion, reinforce brand credibility, and bridge to the provider/user applications.
- Establish scalable design system foundations that support future landing pages, microsites, and logged-in web hubs.

## Research Inputs
- Marketing analytics showing 38% bounce on hero, 22% drop-off on pricing, and low engagement with existing resource hub.
- Interviews with 9 enterprise prospects and 12 SMB customers regarding discovery and decision criteria.
- Accessibility audit identifying issues with contrast, focus order, and keyboard navigation in mega-menu.

## Design Principles
1. **Clarity & Trust:** Present offerings with clear messaging, social proof, and transparent pricing.
2. **Performance:** Optimise for fast load times by reducing heavy media, preloading critical assets, and ensuring layout stability.
3. **Consistency:** Align typography, colour, and components with provider/user apps using shared tokens.
4. **Flexibility:** Create modular sections configurable for campaigns without engineering involvement.

## Key Deliverables
- Responsive wireframes and high-fidelity designs for homepage, solutions pages, resource hub, pricing, logged-in dashboard, and the expanded post-auth navigation featuring Feed → Explore → Create → Dashboard → Profile.
- Mega-menu architecture documentation with content templates per column.
- Component library updates covering hero modules, testimonial sliders, pricing cards, CTA bars, role-based panel widgets (admin, agency, company, freelancer, headhunter, mentorship), creation studio layouts, networking lounges, volunteering marketplace, interview room, job listing manager, budget dashboards, messaging inbox overlays, account/finance settings, and legal pages.
- Interaction specifications for animations, scroll-triggered elements, and responsive breakpoints.
- Analytics instrumentation plan mapping key interactions to event taxonomy.

## Stakeholder Alignment
- Marketing, Product, Sales Enablement, and Web Engineering weekly sync.
- Legal review for compliance-related sections (privacy, cookie consent).
- Brand and content teams providing photography, copy guidelines, and tone.

## Timeline
| Week | Focus | Outputs |
|------|-------|---------|
| 1 | Research synthesis & IA | Updated sitemap, persona journeys |
| 2 | Wireframes | Low/mid fidelity responsive layouts |
| 3 | Visual design | High-fidelity comps with motion notes |
| 4 | Component documentation | Design system updates, token alignment |
| 5 | Handoff | Annotated specs, asset exports, developer walkthrough |
| 6 | QA support | Visual QA, accessibility validation, analytics checks |

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Content readiness delays** → create placeholder templates and parallel copywriting sprint.
- **Performance regression** → partner with engineering on lighthouse budgets and asset compression guidelines.
- **Stakeholder scope creep** → maintain change log, escalate new requests to steering committee.

## Success Metrics
- Increase hero CTA click-through by 20%.
- Reduce homepage bounce to <28%.
- Improve demo request conversion rate by 15%.
- Achieve Lighthouse performance score ≥ 90 and accessibility ≥ 95.

## Next Steps
- Finalise asset library with updated photography and illustrations.
- Validate wireframes with stakeholder review and user testing.
- Prepare development handoff package and QA checklist.
