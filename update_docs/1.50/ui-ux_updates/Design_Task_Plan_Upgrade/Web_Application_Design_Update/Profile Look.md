# Logged-In Profile Look & Feel â€” Web Application v1.50

## Visual Direction
- Maintain cohesive styling with provider portal while adapting to desktop web environment.
- Use card-based layout highlighting key info (profile summary, verification status, activity).

## Layout
- Left column: profile photo, contact info, verification badges.
- Right column: tabbed content (Overview, Activity, Settings).
- Summary metrics row showing gigs managed, satisfaction score, upcoming events.

## Imagery & Icons
- Profile photo displayed in circular frame 96px with status ring (online/offline).
- Badge icons representing certifications and achievements.

## Interactions
- Inline editing for contact info with immediate save.
- Hover reveals additional details (full contact info, timezone).
- Activity feed with filters (messages, assignments, payouts).

## Accessibility
- Ensure profile cards reachable via keyboard; focus outlines on interactive elements.
- Provide alt text for profile images; allow upload with preview and cropping.

## Responsive Behaviour
- On mobile, stack sections vertically; summary metrics convert to scrollable cards.
