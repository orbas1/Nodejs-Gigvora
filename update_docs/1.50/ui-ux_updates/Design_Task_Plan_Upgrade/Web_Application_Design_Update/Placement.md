# Component Placement Rules â€” Web Application v1.50

## Hero & CTA Placement
- Primary hero CTA always positioned above fold with secondary CTA adjacent.
- Secondary CTA repeated mid-page and near footer to capture late-stage interest.

## Social Proof Placement
- Testimonials positioned after value proposition to reinforce credibility.
- Customer logo strip near hero for instant trust; rotate logos to avoid repetition.
- Case studies located before pricing to provide context before conversion ask.

## Forms Placement
- Demo request form embedded mid-page and accessible via sticky header button.
- Short email capture form in footer; emphasise value of newsletter content.

## Support Elements
- Live chat widget accessible from persistent bubble bottom-right; ensure not obstructing CTAs.
- Support hotline and resource center link located in footer and sticky contact bar.

## Logged-In Dashboard Placement
- Quick actions top-left for immediate tasks.
- Insights card and alerts placed right column.
- Reports and analytics modules follow chronological order of decision-making.

## Responsive Adjustments
- On mobile, CTAs stacked vertically with primary first.
- Social proof carousels replace multi-column grids.
- Chat/support icon moves to top nav to prevent overlay with bottom navigation (if used).

## Testing & Validation
- Use heatmaps to verify attention distribution matches placement assumptions.
- Conduct A/B tests when adjusting CTA placement to confirm impact.
- Monitor scroll depth analytics to ensure critical content appears before drop-off points.
