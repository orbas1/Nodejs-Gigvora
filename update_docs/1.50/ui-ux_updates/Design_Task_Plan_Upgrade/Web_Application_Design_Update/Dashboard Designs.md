# Logged-In Dashboard Design — Web Application v1.50

## Dashboard Goals
- Provide executives and coordinators with at-a-glance insight into workforce performance.
- Surface actionable items (tasks, alerts) without overwhelming users.
- Align visual language with provider portal for continuity.

## Layout Structure
- Hero banner summarising account status, plan usage, and quick actions.
- KPI row with four tiles (Active gigs, Pending approvals, SLA risk, Revenue trend).
- Main content area split into two columns: left for operational modules, right for insights/support.
- Footer area linking to detailed analytics and support resources.

## Modules
1. **Gig Pipeline** — Funnel visual, filter by region/service.
2. **Activity Feed** — Chronological events with icons and quick actions.
3. **Task List** — Assignments with due dates and status toggles.
4. **Insights Panel** — Recommendations generated by analytics (e.g., "Add weekend coverage").
5. **Support Alerts** — Compliance notices, policy updates, release notes.

## Visual Styling
- Use card components with consistent padding and shadows.
- Chart colours aligned with brand palette.
- Include skeleton loading states for each module.

## Interactions
- KPI tiles clickable to open detailed analytics modal.
- Task list supports inline completion and assignment.
- Insights panel allows dismiss/learn more actions.

## Accessibility & Responsiveness
- Keyboard navigation across modules; focus outlines on interactive elements.
- Responsive layout transitions to single column on ≤1024px.
- Provide alt text for charts or accessible data tables.

## Analytics
- Track module interactions, quick action usage, and dismissed insights to refine recommendations.

## QA Alignment Notes — 01 May 2024
- Backend Supertests now exercise the admin consent governance console end-to-end. Filtering, activation modals, and audit badges described in this document are verified against live `/api/admin/governance/consents` responses, so no additional UI adjustments are required while the QA log captures regression evidence.
