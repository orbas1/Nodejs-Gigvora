# Settings Screen Blueprint â€” Application v1.50

## Screen Layout
- **Header:** Title, description, quick link to documentation, and search within settings.
- **Secondary Navigation:** Horizontal tab bar (General, Team, Notifications, etc.) with sticky behaviour.
- **Content Area:** Two-column layout on desktop (main content + summary sidebar), stacked on mobile.
- **Summary Sidebar:** Displays key metrics (pending invites, billing status) and shortcuts.

## Component Inventory
- Form sections with labelled fields, toggles, dropdowns, and file uploads.
- Status cards for critical items (e.g., "Payout account verified").
- Audit log table listing recent changes with filter options.
- Help drawer trigger providing contextual guidance and contact link.

## Interaction Flow
1. User selects tab; content loads with skeleton placeholders.
2. Edits fields; changes saved via save button or auto-save (depending on section).
3. Success toast confirms update; summary sidebar refreshes status.
4. For sensitive actions, modal confirmation prompts re-authentication.

## Accessibility & Responsiveness
- Tab order aligns with visual order; arrow keys navigate tabs.
- Ensure forms accessible via screen readers with clear labels and error messaging.
- On mobile, action buttons anchored bottom for reachability.
- Provide alternate layout for large text mode with increased spacing.

## Error Handling
- Inline validation errors highlight problematic fields.
- Global error banner appears for API failures with retry option.
- Logging includes correlation ID displayed for support reference.

## Analytics & Telemetry
- Events: `settings_tab_viewed`, `settings_field_updated`, `settings_error`, `settings_help_opened`.
- Track time spent per section and frequency of edits.
- Monitor usage of accessibility options to inform future enhancements.

## Testing Checklist
- Validate tab navigation via keyboard and screen reader.
- Simulate slow network to ensure skeletons and retries behave correctly.
- Confirm audit log updates after each change.
- Verify localisation support for long text and right-to-left languages (future-proofing).
