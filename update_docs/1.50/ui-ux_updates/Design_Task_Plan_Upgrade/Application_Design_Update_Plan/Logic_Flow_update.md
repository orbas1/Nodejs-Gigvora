# Logic Flow Update Plan — Application v1.50

## Objectives
- Define the end-to-end flow architecture for redesigned experiences ensuring clarity, consistency, and measurable outcomes.
- Align product, design, and engineering on branching logic, automation triggers, and integration dependencies.

## Key Journeys to Update
1. Provider onboarding and activation
2. Gig intake, qualification, and assignment
3. Consumer gig creation and booking confirmation
4. Messaging and negotiation lifecycle
5. Financial reconciliation and payout management
6. Settings and security configuration

## Methodology
- Map existing flows highlighting pain points, decision nodes, and system touchpoints.
- Co-create future-state flow diagrams in cross-functional workshops.
- Validate flows with stakeholders and pilot users before freezing.

## Deliverables
- Annotated flow diagrams with swimlanes (user, system, integrations).
- State definitions for success, error, pending, and edge cases.
- Event taxonomy linking flow stages to analytics instrumentation.
- Checklist aligning each flow with accessibility, compliance, and performance requirements.

## Collaboration Cadence
- Weekly flow review meetings with design, product, engineering leads.
- Async feedback captured in shared FigJam boards with comment resolution tracking.
- Integration sync with backend architects to confirm API readiness.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Complex branching** may overwhelm users → incorporate progressive disclosure and contextual guidance.
- **Integration delays** could block automation → design manual fallback paths.
- **Compliance updates** may change requirements → include review checkpoint with legal/compliance before handoff.

## Success Metrics
- Reduced time-to-task for key flows (onboarding, gig assignment, booking).
- Increased conversion rates and decreased abandonment within flows.
- Positive qualitative feedback from usability testing sessions.

## Next Steps
- Finalise future-state diagrams and circulate for sign-off.
- Translate flows into user stories and acceptance criteria for development teams.
- Plan usability tests to validate comprehension and efficiency.
