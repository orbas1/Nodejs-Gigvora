# Application Design Update Plan â€” Version 1.50

## Strategic Overview
- **Objective:** Deliver a cohesive multi-platform application experience emphasising speed-to-task, brand consistency, and measurable business outcomes for providers and consumers.
- **Scope of Work:** Cover dashboards, onboarding, messaging, scheduling, finance, and support modules across native and responsive surfaces.
- **Success Metrics:** Reduce critical workflow completion time by 20%, improve Net Promoter Score by 12 points, and achieve WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for top 10 user journeys.

## Research & Discovery Inputs
1. **Quantitative Data Sources**
   - Session analytics highlighting drop-off points in onboarding (+32% at document upload) and gig creation (+24% at pricing step).
   - Heatmaps identifying low interaction zones on dashboard cards and navigation rails.
   - Support ticket taxonomy for UI-related issues (navigation confusion, inconsistent button states, unclear error messages).
2. **Qualitative Research**
   - Contextual inquiries with 18 provider admins, 12 consumers, 6 internal support agents.
   - Diary study capturing week-long engagement with provider command center.
   - Accessibility audits performed by external specialists covering keyboard navigation and screen reader support.
3. **Competitive Benchmarking**
   - Evaluated 5 competitor platforms for onboarding efficiency, analytics presentation, and messaging paradigms.
   - Documented differentiators and opportunities to leapfrog (e.g., collaborative scheduling, AI recommendations).

## Design Principles
- **Clarity First:** Present information with meaningful hierarchy, progressive disclosure, and focus on user intent.
- **System Integrity:** Leverage shared design tokens, component library, and motion guidelines to ensure parity across surfaces.
- **Inclusivity:** Provide accessible interactions, localisation readiness, and flexible personalisation settings.
- **Performance Awareness:** Optimise asset delivery, layout stability, and component complexity to maintain responsive apps.

## Deliverables & Artefacts
- Updated Figma component library with provider/user/web variants and documented usage rules.
- Detailed wireframes (low, mid, high fidelity) for 37 screens across key journeys.
- Flow diagrams covering onboarding, gig creation, queue management, messaging, payments, and support escalation.
- Style guide addendums for typography, color, iconography, motion, and imagery updates.
- Implementation packages: token JSON, CSS/SCSS partials, React/Flutter component references, accessibility checklists.
- QA scripts for visual regression, interaction parity, and copy review.

## Stakeholder Alignment
- **Core Team:** Product Lead, Design Lead, Engineering Managers (web/native), QA Lead, Data Analyst.
- **Consulted Stakeholders:** Support operations, Compliance, Marketing, Sales Enablement.
- **Decision Log:** Weekly sign-off meetings with documented approvals and change requests stored in DesignOps repo.

## Timeline & Milestones
| Week | Milestone | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | Discovery Synthesis | Consolidate research findings, define personas, update journey maps |
| 2 | Information Architecture | Finalise navigation models, sitemap, and taxonomy for shared components |
| 3 | Wireframing Sprint | Produce low/mid fidelity wireframes, iterate via stakeholder reviews |
| 4 | Visual & Interaction Design | Apply styling, motion specs, accessibility annotations |
| 5 | Handoff & QA Prep | Package design tokens, documentation, review with engineering |
| 6 | Design QA | Validate staging builds, log defects, prepare launch checklist |

## Risk Management
- **Dependency on API Enhancements:** Coordinate with backend team for analytics endpoints; include contingency timeline.
- **Brand Update Synchronisation:** Align with marketing rebrand deliverables to avoid mismatched assets.
- **Resource Constraints:** Maintain design capacity plan with backup contractors for peak weeks.
- **Compliance Changes:** Monitor regulatory updates impacting identity verification and payments.

## Communication Plan
- Daily stand-ups with design & engineering pairing.
- Weekly stakeholder demos summarising progress, upcoming decisions, and blockers.
- Async updates via shared design log and annotated prototypes.
- Post-release retrospective capturing learnings for v1.51 roadmap.

## Success Measurement & Follow-Up
- Track KPI dashboards post-launch for workflow completion time, adoption rate of new components, and satisfaction surveys.
- Conduct 30-day post-launch usability review to collect feedback and prioritise iteration backlog.
- Maintain living documentation to reflect incremental enhancements beyond v1.50.
