# Screens Update Summary â€” Application v1.50

## Scope of Screens Reviewed
- Provider Dashboard suite (Command Center, Team Performance, Finance Overview, Compliance Hub).
- Consumer Mobile screens (Discover, Gig Detail, Gig Creation Steps, Messages, Bookings, Profile).
- Shared components across Settings, Notifications, Support, and Help overlays.

## Prioritised Screens for Redesign
1. **Provider Command Center**
   - Increase scanability of KPI tiles, introduce quick-action shortcuts, and restructure grid layout for modularity.
2. **Queue Management**
   - Simplify list density options, highlight SLA breaches, and add contextual drawers for deeper context.
3. **Consumer Gig Creation**
   - Introduce progress tracker, contextual helper copy, and autosave for long forms.
4. **Messaging Thread**
   - Redesign composer for attachments, quick replies, and status callouts.
5. **Settings & Preferences**
   - Consolidate dispersed settings into tabbed hub with consistent form styling.

## Screen Inventory Updates
| Screen | Current Issues | Proposed Actions | Dependencies |
|--------|----------------|------------------|--------------|
| Provider Dashboard | Dense layout, inconsistent card heights | Modular card grid, consistent elevation, inline filters | Analytics API updates |
| Queue List | Hard to triage, limited context | Add severity badges, quick bulk actions, detail drawer | Notification system |
| Gig Creation Step 2 | Long scroll, unclear requirements | Break into sections, add inline tips, attachments summary | Content copywriting |
| Messages | Mixed visual hierarchy, missing quick actions | Introduce left filter tabs, new composer, inline system cards | Messaging backend |
| Profile Settings | Fragmented sections | Tabbed navigation, consistent forms, highlight verification status | Auth services |

## Layout Adjustments
- Define 12-column grid for desktop, 4-column for tablet, 2-column for mobile with responsive breakpoints documented.
- Implement sticky sidebars for key actions while ensuring accessibility (keyboard focus, screen reader cues).
- Introduce consistent spacing tokens (8/12/16/24/32/48) applied across all screens.

## Interaction Improvements
- Add skeleton states for loading dashboards and messaging threads.
- Provide inline validation with contextual tooltips for forms.
- Introduce micro-interactions for button presses, card hovers, and drawer transitions.

## Content Updates
- Revise headings, subheadings, and helper copy for clarity and inclusive language.
- Standardise tone across success, warning, and error messages.
- Localisation-ready copy with placeholders annotated for translation teams.

## Accessibility Enhancements
- Keyboard navigable focus order for each screen including modals.
- Contrast checks performed for background/foreground combinations.
- Provide accessible labels for icon buttons, toggles, and overflow menus.

## QA Checklist for Screens
- Visual parity verified against high-fidelity designs.
- Responsive behaviour validated across breakpoints and device simulations.
- Interaction flows tested for success, error, and edge cases.
- Copy reviewed for grammar, tone, and localisation markers.

## Next Steps
- Finalise high-fidelity mockups for remaining screens.
- Align with engineering on implementation order and dependencies.
- Prepare usability testing plan focusing on top-priority workflows (onboarding, gig creation, queue triage).
