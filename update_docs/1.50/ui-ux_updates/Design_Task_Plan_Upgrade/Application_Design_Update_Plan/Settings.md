# Settings Architecture — Application v1.50

## Objectives
- Consolidate fragmented settings into a unified hub with intuitive navigation.
- Provide role-based access controls and transparent change history.
- Ensure critical settings (security, payouts) are easy to locate and update.

## Information Architecture
1. **General** — Company details, branding, regional preferences.
2. **Team & Permissions** — Member management, roles, access scopes.
3. **Notifications** — Channel preferences, digest scheduling, quiet hours.
4. **Payments & Billing** — Payout accounts, invoices, tax info, plan management.
5. **Security & Privacy** — MFA, session management, data export/delete.
6. **Integrations** — Third-party apps, API keys, webhook management.
7. **Accessibility & Personalisation** — Theme, font size, language, accessibility options.

## Navigation Model
- Tabbed navigation on desktop with sub-tabs as needed.
- Overflow menu on mobile converting tabs into dropdown list.
- Breadcrumbs for deep sections (e.g., Integrations > Slack > Settings).

## UX Patterns
- Section overview panels summarising key statuses (e.g., "2 teammates pending invite").
- Inline edit forms with optimistic updates and undo option.
- Audit log panel accessible from each section showing recent changes.
- Contextual help links to documentation and support for sensitive settings.

## Security Considerations
- Sensitive actions require re-authentication (payout changes, API key regeneration).
- Provide confirmation modals with explicit description of impact.
- Display last updated timestamp and user for transparency.

## Accessibility
- Ensure focus order preserved when switching tabs.
- Provide clear success/error feedback for screen reader users.
- Offer keyboard shortcuts for navigating between sections where appropriate.

## Implementation Notes
- Settings hub built using layout template with sticky sub-navigation and scrollspy highlights.
- Each section includes analytics events capturing view, edit, save, error.
- Provide QA checklist verifying role-based visibility and error handling.
