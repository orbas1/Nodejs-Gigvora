# Screens Update Plan — Application v1.50

## Planning Goals
- Sequence redesign work to support agile delivery and minimise disruption to in-progress features.
- Ensure cross-functional alignment on acceptance criteria, dependencies, and rollout strategy for each screen.
- Validate updates with user testing prior to development handoff.

## Workstreams & Owners
| Workstream | Lead | Supporting Roles | Notes |
|------------|------|------------------|-------|
| Provider Dashboard | Product Designer A | Data Analyst, Frontend Engineer | Requires new analytics API endpoints |
| Queue Management | Product Designer B | Operations SME, Backend Engineer | Dependent on notification infrastructure |
| Consumer Mobile Gig Creation | Mobile Designer | Copywriter, React Native Engineer | Must coordinate with localisation |
| Messaging Experience | Interaction Designer | Support Lead, QA Analyst | High focus on compliance and logging |
| Settings Hub | UX Architect | Security Lead, Platform Engineer | Align with privacy & permissions updates |

## Sprint Breakdown
1. **Sprint 1 — Discovery & Alignment**
   - Finalise research synthesis, define user stories, and update personas.
   - Map existing journeys and identify breakpoints causing confusion.
2. **Sprint 2 — Wireframing & Validation**
   - Produce low-fidelity wireframes for high-priority screens.
   - Conduct rapid feedback sessions with stakeholders and pilot users.
   - Iterate based on testing insights.
3. **Sprint 3 — High-Fidelity Design**
   - Apply visual styling, interaction specs, and motion guidelines.
   - Prepare responsive variants and state definitions.
4. **Sprint 4 — Handoff & QA**
   - Package design files with annotations, accessibility notes, and token references.
   - Schedule design QA checkpoints aligned with development sprints.

## Dependencies & Assumptions
- Analytics team delivering updated metrics API by week 3.
- Notification framework to support new messaging alerts before sprint 4.
- Content strategy ready with updated copy guidelines by design lock.
- Availability of engineering bandwidth for pair design reviews.
- Prometheus exporter `/health/metrics` endpoint delivering scrape freshness and uptime fields prior to admin/mobile telemetry card build so UI states remain accurate.

## Risk Mitigation
- Maintain backlog of stretch goals to de-scope if resource constraints arise.
- Document alternatives for components dependent on future APIs.
- Establish visual regression baseline to detect implementation drift.
- Include buffer in timeline for compliance review feedback.

## Testing Strategy
- Remote usability testing for dashboard and gig creation flows.
- Accessibility audits focusing on keyboard navigation and screen reader cues.
- A/B testing plan for landing hero vs. alternative CTA placements.
- Beta rollouts to limited provider cohorts to observe behavioural changes.

## Rollout Approach
- Phased release with feature toggles enabling controlled exposure.
- In-app announcements and onboarding tips to educate users on new layouts.
- Monitor telemetry for performance regressions and user friction.
- Collect feedback via in-app surveys and support ticket tagging.

## Success Criteria
- Target satisfaction score ≥ 4.3/5 on post-release surveys for redesigned screens.
- 20% reduction in average time to assign gig via queue management.
- 15% increase in completion rate for consumer gig creation flow.
- Zero critical accessibility or compliance issues post-launch.

## Documentation & Handoff
- Maintain central Confluence hub linking to design specs, component documentation, and testing results.
- Schedule walkthrough with engineering teams per platform prior to development start.
- Provide QA scripts mapping design acceptance criteria to test cases.
