# User (Talent & Client) App â€“ Wireframe Changes

## Global Navigation
- **Bottom Navigation Update:** Converted to a five-tab layout (Home, Feed, Work, Discover, Profile) with central floating action button for "Create" (project, post, job depending on persona).
- **Contextual Drawer:** Swiping from the right opens quick settings, saved searches, and support options to reduce menu depth.

## Home & Feed
- **Personalised Home Screen:** Features stacked hero cards for active work, alerts, and Launchpad tasks followed by recommendation rows.
- **Live Feed Redesign:** Cards support carousels, polls, and action buttons (Apply, Follow, Share). Comments preview within the card to reduce taps.
- **Notification Digest:** Inline module summarises unread messages, approvals, and payouts, encouraging daily check-ins.

## Workflows
- **Project Workspace:** Tabbed view (Overview, Tasks, Files, Chat, Escrow). Each tab uses sticky action bars for key operations.
- **Jobs & Gigs Listing:** Utilises segmented controls (Gigs, Jobs, Contests, Volunteer) with filter chips pinned for one-handed use.
- **Launchpad Coach:** Stepper wireframe showing readiness score, pending assessments, and recommended gigs.

## Profile & Reputation
- **Profile Overview:** Modular sections (About, Experience timeline, Credentials, Portfolio, Trust score, Testimonials) with edit shortcuts.
- **Trust Badge System:** Wireframes include tooltips explaining score drivers and CTA to complete missing requirements.
- **Analytics Snapshot:** Introduced a mini dashboard for engagement metrics (views, saves, likes) with trend arrows.

## Communication & Support
- **Unified Inbox:** Combined project, job, and support conversations. Each thread displays status tags (Awaiting action, In review).
- **Floating Chat Bubble:** Mirrors provider experience with quick reply templates and escalation toggles.

## Onboarding & Guidance
- **Persona Selector:** Early flow asking if user is talent, client, or both. Determines which tutorial slides and default tab arrangement appear.
- **Guided Tours:** Overlay steps triggered for new modules (Launchpad, Ads, Live feed publishing) with skip/resume controls.

## Accessibility & Responsiveness
- Adaptive typography and high-contrast toggles accessible from profile settings.
- All carousels support swipe and accessible previous/next buttons.
