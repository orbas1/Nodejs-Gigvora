# Logic Flow Update â€“ Web Application v1.50

## Overview
The web application logic aligns with the cross-platform workflow overhaul documented in `web_application_logic_flow_changes.md`. The update simplifies navigation pathways, reduces dead-ends, and ensures data persistence across tabs.

## Key Enhancements
1. **Unified entry points**
   - All major actions accessible from omnibox (Cmd/Ctrl + K) with fuzzy search and command palette grouping.
   - Quick-create button provides context-sensitive menu (gig, project, invoice, integration).

2. **Stateful navigation**
   - Query parameters persist filters and sort orders across tabs and sessions.
   - Route guards check permissions and data readiness, routing users to guided setup when prerequisites missing.

3. **Task orchestration**
   - Launchpad tasks stack into priority queue; completion triggers toast, updated checklist, and analytics event.
   - Background jobs (file processing, payout calculation) push progress updates to notification centre.

4. **Error handling**
   - Global error boundary shows friendly message with retry and support contact.
   - Inline errors mapped to component-level alerts; logging pipeline tags user, workspace, and route context.

5. **Cross-device continuity**
   - Drafts saved to cloud enabling continuation across web and phone experiences.
   - Notification centre sync ensures actions taken on phone reflect on web without manual refresh.

## Integration with Backend
- GraphQL queries use fragments aligned with component needs to avoid over-fetching.
- Optimistic updates for status changes; roll back gracefully on failure with contextual messaging.
- WebSockets handle presence, chat, and job board updates with reconnection logic (exponential backoff, offline banner).
