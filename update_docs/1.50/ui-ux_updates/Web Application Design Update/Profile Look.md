# Profile Look & Feel â€“ Web Application v1.50

## Visual Direction
- Clean two-column layout: left column for avatar, contact info, verification badges; right column for bio, skills, history.
- Use accent highlights for verified badges and key metrics.
- Background uses subtle gradient block behind avatar to add depth.

## Sections
1. **Header:** Large avatar (160px), name, role, organisation, verification icons, quick actions (Message, Share, Add to project).
2. **About & Skills:** Rich text bio, skill chips with proficiency levels, link to portfolio.
3. **Experience timeline:** Chronological cards with role, company, duration, achievements.
4. **Ratings & Reviews:** Star rating, testimonial quotes, sortable list.
5. **Compliance & Documents:** Accordion listing verified IDs, certifications, NDAs with download links.
6. **Activity Overview:** Recent contributions, tasks completed, upcoming deadlines.

## Styling Notes
- Profile header overlay uses glassmorphism effect (background blur 16px) on hero image.
- CTA buttons align to the right, with responsive stacking on mobile.
- Document list uses icon per file type and status indicator (verified/pending).
