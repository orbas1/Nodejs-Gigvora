# Home Page Layout – Organisation Persona

## Goals
- Showcase operational benefits for organisations (faster hiring, escrow security, compliance automation).
- Provide immediate entry points into Launchpad onboarding and gig publishing flows.

## Structure
1. **Hero banner** with persona toggle (Talent / Organisation). When organisation selected, CTA emphasises "Launch your first gig".
2. **Trust metrics strip**: displays fill rate, average time-to-contract, escrow protected volume with animated counters.
3. **Feature pillars** (3-column): Recruit, Manage, Pay. Each card includes icon, short descriptor, and CTA linking to deeper page.
4. **Workflow visualisation**: stepper diagram showing Post → Collaborate → Pay → Measure; each step clickable to open modal with video snippet.
5. **Testimonials carousel**: rotates enterprise client quotes with logos.
6. **Integration showcase**: grid of partner tools (Slack, QuickBooks, Zapier) with deep-link to resources.
7. **FAQ accordion**: addresses compliance, onboarding support, billing cycles.
8. **Footer**: includes resources, legal links, global office info.

## Behaviour
- Sticky sub-nav appears after hero scroll, allowing jump to sections.
- CTA buttons update copy depending on authentication state ("Sign up" vs "Go to Dashboard").
- On smaller screens, convert 3-column sections into vertical stacks with alternating background for readability.
