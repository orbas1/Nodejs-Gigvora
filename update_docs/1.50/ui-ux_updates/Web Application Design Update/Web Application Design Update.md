# Web Application Design Update – Version 1.50

## Executive Summary
Version 1.50 finalises the first production-ready Gigvora web experience. The update harmonises the React dashboard with the refreshed marketing surfaces and unifies tokens across the multi-platform design system outlined in the global design change log. It focuses on three pillars:

1. **Trust-centred visual language.** Escrow transparency, dispute visibility, and compliance status are now surfaced through status rails, contextual banners, and smart alerts that reuse the cross-platform blue-focused palette.
2. **Workflow velocity.** Core actions—publishing gigs, managing projects, releasing payments, escalating issues—are compressed into two-click journeys through contextual side panels, inline editors, and consistent keyboard shortcuts.
3. **Scalable componentisation.** All layouts rely on responsive grids, reusable cards, and composable widgets that ship as documented React components backed by the shared design tokens.

## Responsive Strategy
- **Breakpoints:** `xs <576px`, `sm ≥576px`, `md ≥768px`, `lg ≥992px`, `xl ≥1200px`, `xxl ≥1440px`. Layout scaffolds scale by adjusting grid columns (4 → 12) and spacing ramp (8 → 24px).
- **Container behaviour:** Max-width containers align with marketing hero sections (1280px) while dashboards adopt fluid widths with safe-area padding (24px desktop, 16px tablet, 12px phone).
- **Navigation adjustments:** Primary side navigation collapses to icons at `md`, becomes top nav at `sm`, and converts to bottom dock on `xs` for parity with the Flutter phone app.

## Priority Themes
- **Consistency with provider and user apps:** Page scaffolds reuse Launchpad, Live Feed, Volunteer, and Ads modules defined in the provider and user wireframe change logs, ensuring cross-device familiarity.
- **Low-friction onboarding:** Home, dashboard, and settings flows embed checklists, tooltips, and guided tours synchronised with the logic flow updates.
- **Accessibility:** Colour choices meet WCAG AA; interactive areas exceed 44px; ARIA mapping enumerated in component function specs; focus management codified in the CSS/SCSS guidelines.

## Deliverables
This directory contains detailed specifications for components, styles, flows, page layouts, and data/navigation requirements. The documents are structured to be consumed directly by the React implementation and align with the cross-application design governance captured in:
- `design_change_log.md`
- `web_app_wireframe_changes.md`
- `web_application_logic_flow_changes.md`
- `web_application_styling_changes.md`
