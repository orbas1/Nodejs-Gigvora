# Text & Content Guidelines â€“ Web Application v1.50

## Voice & Tone
- Maintain confident, supportive voice that balances professionalism with warmth.
- Use action-oriented language ("Publish gig", "Review applicants") and avoid jargon that fails cross-region audiences.
- Provide inline explanations for financial terms (hover reveals definitions for escrow, net terms, disputes).

## Messaging Framework
| Scenario | Primary Message | Secondary Details | CTA |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| First-time user | "Welcome to Gigvora Launchpad" | Highlight completion checklist and support availability. | "Start setup" |
| Active project | "You're on track" | Summarise milestone progress and upcoming deadlines. | "View tasks" |
| Escrow warning | "Action needed" | Explain hold reason, provide direct escalation path. | "Resolve now" |
| Community updates | "New opportunities in your network" | Emphasise relevance via skills/location tags. | "Explore gigs" |

## Microcopy Standards
- Buttons: Title case, maximum 24 characters.
- Form labels: Sentence case, concise (max 4 words), appended helper text as needed.
- Validation errors: Start with verb ("Enter a valid email"), avoid blame.
- Tooltips: 1 sentence, plain language, no technical acronyms without explanation.

## Internationalisation
- Support dynamic placeholders for locale-specific currency and date formats.
- Avoid hard-coded idioms; rely on translation keys that map to tone guidelines.
- Right-to-left languages tested for nav, forms, and tables to ensure mirrored layout remains usable.
