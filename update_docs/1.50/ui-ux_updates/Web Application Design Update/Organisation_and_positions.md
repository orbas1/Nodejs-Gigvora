# Organisations & Positioning â€“ Web Application v1.50

## Organisation Personas
- **Startup teams:** Need rapid gig creation, lightweight approvals, simple analytics.
- **Enterprise HR/Operations:** Require compliance oversight, multi-workspace governance, integration depth.
- **Non-profit coordinators:** Focused on volunteer management, community impact metrics.

## Positioning Statements
- "Gigvora protects your contingent workforce lifecycle from sourcing to payout." (Enterprise)
- "Ship projects faster with a Launchpad that keeps every gig on track." (Startup)
- "Mobilise volunteers with transparent impact tracking and secure disbursements." (Non-profit)

## Value Messaging per Persona
| Persona | Primary Value | Supporting Proof |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Startup | Speed to launch, affordable pricing | Pre-built templates, AI matching recommendations, low transaction fees. |
| Enterprise | Control & compliance | Escrow audit trails, SSO, granular permissions, SOC 2 roadmap. |
| Non-profit | Impact storytelling | Volunteer hub, donation tracking, automated thank-you flows. |

## Experience Adjustments
- CTA labels adapt per persona ("Launch gig" vs "Mobilise volunteers").
- Dashboard modules reorder to surface relevant metrics (e.g., compliance card pinned for enterprise).
- Onboarding checklist tasks tailored by persona selection.
