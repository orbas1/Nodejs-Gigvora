# Web App â€“ Styling Changes

## Visual Language
- Adopted responsive grid system with 12-column base and 16px baseline grid. Gutters adjust at each breakpoint for optimal density.
- Introduced blue gradient hero treatments with animated particle overlay for marketing surfaces; product surfaces use subdued neutrals.

## Typography
- Heading hierarchy uses **Manrope** (H1 48px down to H6 16px). Body copy utilises **Inter** 16px with 150% line height.
- Data tables use semi-mono numeric style for alignment.

## Components
- Buttons feature consistent corner radius (12px) and gradient or outline variants. Loading states display progress bars or skeletons.
- Tabs redesigned with underline indicator and overflow dropdown for small widths.
- Data visualisation updated with brand colours, accessibility-friendly palettes, and tooltip enhancements.

## Imagery & Iconography
- Updated icon library to duotone style, ensuring cross-platform consistency.
- Hero illustrations depict collaboration between talent, agencies, and companies, matching marketing messaging.

## Motion & Interaction
- Reduced motion preference respected by disabling parallax and large-scale transitions.
- Microinteractions highlight row hover, selection states, and inline validations.

## Accessibility
- Ensured WCAG AA compliance across backgrounds/text combos.
- Keyboard navigation improved with visible focus states and skip links.
