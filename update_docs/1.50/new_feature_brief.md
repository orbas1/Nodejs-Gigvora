## Feature Themes & Rationale
### Enterprise Level Upgrade & Delivery Confidence (Req. 71, 73, 83, 88, 94, 117)
- Establish high-availability infrastructure, observability dashboards, and incident response runbooks.

- Ensure every backend feature is activated and connected to its frontend counterpart through documented APIs.

### Financial Stewardship & Payment Compliance (Req. 79, 91-92, 95, 141-142, 145)
- Integrate multiple payment providers (e.g., Stripe/Adyen/PayPal) for redundancy and geographic coverage.

- Surface financial insights, review scores, and audit logs in dashboards while enforcing segregation of duties.

### Intelligent Automatching & Ranking (Req. 77, 128, 141)
- Build a modular matching engine capable of per-project enablement with configurable scoring weights, opt-out controls, and explainability.
- Extend ranking algorithms across live feed, search, and recommendation surfaces so matches feel consistent and personalised.

### Integration Fabric & AI Enablement (Req. 81-82, 107, 109-110)
- Ship OAuth-backed integrations for HubSpot, Salesforce, Slack, Google Drive, GitHub, and messaging providers.
- Provide AI orchestration that supports OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, and xAI Grok with tenant-specific key management and per-feature toggles.

- Redesign UI with cohesive colour system, typography, iconography, and responsive layout patterns across web and mobile.
- Complete dashboard experiences for users, freelancers, companies, agencies, headhunters, mentors, and admins, ensuring every menu item routes to a working module.
- Upgrade messaging, inbox, notifications, profile editing, explorer, live feed, networking, ads management, review system, and taxonomy navigation.
- Deliver compliant marketing pages (Home, About, Terms, Privacy) with compelling visuals, truthful messaging, and purposeful CTAs aimed at early adopters.

### Governance, Roles, and Preferences (Req. 89-90, 111, 113-116)
- Enforce granular RBAC across services and interfaces, covering permissions for creation, moderation, financial views, and admin overrides.
- Provide account preferences, finance settings, language localisation, and menu organisation that adapts by persona.

### Documentation, Tooling, and Developer Experience (Req. 80, 102-103, 143-145)
- Publish updated README, setup guide, and operational runbooks covering web, backend, and mobile deployments.
- Finalise database migrations, seeders, taxonomies, and fixture data to support instant environment bootstrapping.
