# Version 1.50 â€“ New Feature Brief

## Overview
Version 1.50 is a platform-wide transformation that upgrades Gigvora into a fully unified marketplace spanning mobile (Flutter) and web experiences. This release introduces a production-ready Flutter application, rebuilds the website and homepage with a cohesive blue-forward design language, and layers in mission-critical marketplace capabilities such as FCA-compliant escrow, a dynamic live feed, intelligent discovery, advanced project allocation, and comprehensive user profile enhancements. The update emphasizes parity across web and phone apps, deeply integrated communication, and scalable infrastructure powered by Cloudflare R2.

## Strategic Objectives
- **Deliver a 100% production-ready Flutter application** that mirrors all critical marketplace flows across iOS and Android, complete with notification, chat, search, and profile modules.
- **Revitalize the Gigvora brand experience** through a blue-accented redesign of the website, homepage, and mobile UI, harmonizing typography, iconography, and component systems.
- **Expand trust and conversion levers** with FCA-compliant escrow, richer dispute mediation, and transparent trust scoring.
- **Increase marketplace liquidity** through intelligent search (MeiliSearch), live feed engagement, freelancer auto-assign, contests, and a structured jobs board.
- **Strengthen multi-tenant support** for agencies, companies, volunteers, and launchpad participants with tailored workflows, dashboards, and integrations.

## Major Feature Themes & Highlights
### 1. Flutter Mobile App (Full Production Release)
- Ship a fully-featured Flutter app with modular architecture, state management, offline caching, secure auth, and CI/CD pipelines.
- Implement feature parity with the web experience: onboarding, search, project management, jobs board, chat, notifications, and settings.
- Integrate native capabilities (push notifications, biometric login, deep links) and ensure accessibility compliance.

### 2. Communication Enhancements
- Introduce an omnipresent floating chat bubble that bridges live support, user inbox, and project conversations.
- Extend chat to support threaded replies, quick actions (offer acceptance, milestone approvals), and contextual escalation to disputes or support tickets.

### 3. FCA-Compliant Escrow & Payments
- Build an escrow orchestration layer that aligns with UK FCA safeguarding rules: segregated client funds, KYC/AML flows, release controls, and reporting.
- Automate escrow state transitions for projects, contests, and job placements, with admin override tools and audit trails.

### 4. Experience & Interface Overhaul
- Recreate the homepage with conversion-focused storytelling, feature highlights, testimonials, and dynamic gig/project showcases.
- Rebuild the entire website and mobile designs using a refreshed blue palette, modern typography, and component-based layout system.
- Update profile pages with new sections (agency/company types, qualifications, experience timelines, references, trust score, likes/follows) and provide a toggleable profile view.

### 5. Discovery, Engagement, and Community
- Launch a LinkedIn-style live feed with follow/like/comment/share interactions and support for multimedia content, gig/project sharing, and volunteer spotlights.
- Deploy MeiliSearch-backed global search with advanced filters, ranking, synonyms, and cross-entity targeting (projects, gigs, jobs, profiles, agencies).
- Expand volunteer listings, Experience Launchpad matching, and Gigvora Ads to drive participation across user segments.

### 6. Project, Contest, and Workflow Automation
- Add freelancer auto-assignments with configurable criteria, acceptance flows, and fallback reassignment.
- Introduce contest projects (timed competitions, prepaid escrow, cancellation rules) and upgrade dispute resolution into multi-stage pipelines (startup, offers, mediation, arbitration).
- Implement a project management module featuring budgeting, allocations, tasks, milestones, time tracking, and group project support.

### 7. New User Types & Boards
- Define agency and company user types with specialized dashboards for HR, payments distribution, gig/job management, and analytics.
- Roll out a comprehensive employment/jobs board with ATS-style workflows, application stages, screening questions, CV tools, and calendar integrations.

### 8. Infrastructure & Reliability
- Migrate asset storage and delivery to Cloudflare R2 with tiered caching, signed URLs, and lifecycle policies.
- Ensure seamless API coverage for every new workflow, with shared validation, observability, and governance.

## Success Metrics
- 95%+ task completion success in usability testing for mobile onboarding, project creation, and live feed engagement.
- 99.5% uptime for escrow/payment endpoints with zero FCA compliance violations.
- 20% increase in active engagements (likes, follows, shares) within four weeks of launch.
- 15% faster freelancer-job matching via auto-assign and Experience Launchpad flows.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Regulatory compliance:** Engage external FCA compliance review, enforce audit logging, and maintain segregated ledgers.
- **Feature parity gaps:** Maintain a parity checklist spanning web, API, and Flutter to prevent missing flows.
- **Performance scaling:** Implement load testing for MeiliSearch, live feed, and chat services; leverage Cloudflare caching and autoscaling.
- **Change fatigue:** Provide in-app walkthroughs, documentation, and staged rollouts for high-impact features.

## Cross-Team Collaboration Needs
- **Design:** Finalize blue-themed design system, component specs, and accessibility tokens.
- **Engineering:** Coordinate between backend, Flutter, web, and DevOps squads with weekly integration reviews.
- **Compliance & Legal:** Validate escrow, dispute, and ads monetization flows against FCA and advertising standards.
- **Support & Marketing:** Prepare launch materials, help center updates, and support macros for new capabilities.
