# Version 1.50 – New Feature Brief

## Overview
Version 1.50 is a platform-wide transformation that upgrades Gigvora into a fully unified marketplace spanning mobile (Flutter) and web experiences. This release introduces a production-ready Flutter application, rebuilds the website and homepage with a cohesive blue-forward design language, and layers in mission-critical marketplace capabilities such as FCA-compliant escrow, a dynamic live feed, intelligent discovery, advanced project allocation, and comprehensive user profile enhancements. The update emphasizes parity across web and phone apps, deeply integrated communication, and scalable infrastructure powered by Cloudflare R2.

Beyond feature delivery, Version 1.50 positions Gigvora as a trusted, career-long partner for freelancers, agencies, companies, and volunteers. We are standardizing governance, analytics, and support playbooks so that every new workflow includes the same level of transparency, measurability, and compliance rigor. Success will be measured not only through feature completion but also through adoption, satisfaction, and operational resilience.

## Strategic Objectives
- **Deliver a 100% production-ready Flutter application** that mirrors all critical marketplace flows across iOS and Android, complete with notification, chat, search, and profile modules.
- **Revitalize the Gigvora brand experience** through a blue-accented redesign of the website, homepage, and mobile UI, harmonizing typography, iconography, and component systems.
- **Expand trust and conversion levers** with FCA-compliant escrow, richer dispute mediation, transparent trust scoring, and end-to-end reporting.
- **Increase marketplace liquidity** through intelligent search (MeiliSearch), live feed engagement, freelancer auto-assign, contests, and a structured jobs board.
- **Strengthen multi-tenant support** for agencies, companies, volunteers, and launchpad participants with tailored workflows, dashboards, and integrations.

## User Personas & Core Journeys
- **Freelancers (established & Launchpad newcomers):** need instant visibility on relevant gigs/jobs, transparent payment flows, and mobile-first task management. Version 1.50 unlocks automated matching, richer profiles, and mobile productivity tools.
- **Clients & companies:** require streamlined project/job creation, compliant escrow, advertising reach, and access to talent pools (general, launchpad, volunteer). They benefit from redesigned dashboards, project management features, and data insight panels.
- **Agencies:** manage teams, payroll, and multiple concurrent engagements. Dedicated agency dashboards, HR tooling, and project escalation flows give them better oversight and monetization pathways.
- **Support, finance, & compliance teams:** demand observability and auditability across disputes, escrow, and ads. Enhanced admin console features, Cloudflare R2 logging, and standardized reporting satisfy their requirements.

Each persona is mapped to journey blueprints covering discovery, onboarding, engagement, and retention. These blueprints will be validated via moderated usability sessions pre- and post-launch to guarantee parity between Flutter and web touchpoints.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Regulatory compliance:** Engage external FCA compliance review, enforce audit logging, and maintain segregated ledgers.
- **Feature parity gaps:** Maintain a parity checklist spanning web, API, and Flutter to prevent missing flows.
- **Performance scaling:** Implement load testing for MeiliSearch, live feed, and chat services; leverage Cloudflare caching and autoscaling.
- **Change fatigue:** Provide in-app walkthroughs, documentation, and staged rollouts for high-impact features.
- **Data privacy concerns:** Conduct DPIAs for new data collection (trust score inputs, ads targeting) and expand user consent management tooling.
- **Operational overload:** Staff a release command center with rotating SMEs and establish clear escalation runbooks.
- **Dependency risk:** Set explicit exit criteria for third-party integrations (payments, MeiliSearch, analytics) and maintain backup plans.

## Cross-Team Collaboration Needs
- **Design:** Finalize blue-themed design system, component specs, accessibility tokens, and responsive guidelines.
- **Engineering:** Coordinate between backend, Flutter, web, and DevOps squads with weekly integration reviews and shared sprint ceremonies.
- **Compliance & Legal:** Validate escrow, dispute, data privacy, and ads monetization flows against FCA and advertising standards.
- **Support & Marketing:** Prepare launch materials, help center updates, support macros, webinars, and campaign assets.
- **Data & Analytics:** Define event taxonomy, dashboards, and experimentation frameworks for live feed, search, ads, and conversion funnels.
- **People Operations:** Train support/operations staff on new user types, dispute stages, and escalation protocols; update hiring plans for scale.

## Operational Readiness & Rollout Strategy
- **Staged release:** Launch internal alpha, limited beta, and general availability waves, with observability gates and parity sign-offs determining progression.
- **Documentation suite:** Publish developer guides, admin runbooks, and user-facing tutorials. Ensure translation support for priority markets.
- **Customer education:** Host webinars, create quick-start videos, schedule in-app announcements, and run drip email campaigns to maximize adoption.
- **Feedback loops:** Stand up dedicated Slack channels, NPS surveys, and automated issue tagging in support CRM for rapid iteration during the first 90 days.
- **Post-launch governance:** Establish weekly health reviews tracking KPIs, bug trends, and compliance reports to maintain momentum beyond the release window.
