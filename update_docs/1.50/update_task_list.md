# Version 1.50 Update Task List

Each numbered task maps to the update plan and contains explicit integration coverage so cross-functional teams can execute in parallel while maintaining traceability to Version 1.50 requirements and the pre-update defect catalogue.

## Task 1 — Stabilise service lifecycles and security perimeters (62%)
- **Backend:** Separate worker lifecycles from Express, add readiness/liveness probes, and repair the global error handler to satisfy Issue List items 1, 4, and 5.
- **Front-end:** Surface health and rate-limit telemetry in admin dashboards so operators can react to backend degradation (Issues 14–17).
- **User phone app:** Replace mocked connectivity checks with authenticated health polling and secure session bootstrap (Issue 18).
- **Provider phone app:** Mirror health polling and deliver maintenance messaging for provider personas to uphold SLA expectations.
- **Database:** Configure connection pooling, graceful draining, and security auditing triggers tied to shutdown hooks (Fix Suggestion 15).
- **API:** Publish updated OpenAPI docs for health/auth endpoints and enforce payload size limits plus abuse detection.
- **Logic:** Add guard clauses that halt payment/compliance workflows when dependencies fail to avoid cascading outages.
- **Design:** Provide consistent UX copy, iconography, and localisation for maintenance and security prompts across surfaces.

**Progress Note (Backend • 04 Apr):** Node API now boots through a lifecycle orchestrator with graceful shutdown hooks, readiness/liveness endpoints, structured logging with correlation IDs, and environment-tuned payload/rate controls. Background workers run under a managed supervisor with health instrumentation feeding the new `/health/ready` contract.

**Progress Note (Cross-Stack • 07 Apr):** Replaced the legacy express-rate-limit wrapper with an in-process telemetry-aware rate limiter, exposed `/api/admin/runtime/health` via `runtimeObservabilityService`, and delivered an admin dashboard runtime panel with localisation-ready operations copy. Operators now have real-time visibility into dependency state, rate-limit utilisation, and recent block events without leaving the dashboard.

**Progress Note (Backend • 08 Apr):** Rolled out Zod-backed validation middleware across `/api/auth/*` and critical admin routes, coercing and trimming payloads before controller execution. Invalid registration/login requests now return structured `422` responses, while admin dashboard/settings writes reject malformed configuration objects and unsafe query parameters.

**Progress Note (Backend • 09 Apr):** Validation now protects search discovery, saved-search subscriptions, project creation/update flows, and finance control tower endpoints by canonicalising categories, coercing numerics and dates, parsing geo viewports, and shipping Jest coverage to lock in the behaviour.

**Progress Note (Cross-Stack • 10 Apr):** Launched runtime maintenance registry across backend, admin tooling, and Flutter clients. `/api/runtime/maintenance` provides audience-aware downtime banners, admin CRUD endpoints enforce chronology/severity guardrails, observability snapshots surface active windows, and the mobile security repository now consumes live maintenance/health payloads instead of mocks.

**Progress Note (Backend • 11 Apr):** Dependency guard now inspects payments/compliance credentials and active maintenance windows before allowing wallet provisioning, ledger writes, or compliance locker mutations. Guard verdicts update runtime health telemetry, API flows return request-scoped `503` responses when dependencies degrade, and new Jest coverage verifies credential gaps, maintenance-induced read-only states, and healthy configurations.

**Progress Note (Backend • 12 Apr):** Added supertest suites that hit `/api/compliance/documents` and `/api/users/:id`, confirming dependency guard verdicts surface as `503` responses with request IDs when secure storage or payment providers degrade. Hardened membership middleware to remove undefined helpers discovered during test execution.

**Progress Note (Backend • 13 Apr):** Database lifecycle orchestration now warms Sequelize pools before the HTTP server listens, drains connections after traffic stops, and emits audit events plus pool telemetry so operations staff can confirm graceful shutdowns during maintenance windows.
**Progress Note (Backend • 14 Apr):** Published the hashed runtime OpenAPI specification, exposed it through `/api/docs/runtime-security` with cache-aware headers, and refactored observability services to surface scheduled maintenance summaries alongside readiness pool metrics. API clients now share a single documented contract for health/auth flows, lifting Task 1 integration and production confidence.
**Progress Note (Backend • 10 Apr):** Introduced runtime dependency guards around finance/compliance services so wallet, payout, and verification workflows return consistent 503 responses during Stripe/Escrow outages, with platform settings updates automatically resynchronising dependency health for admin telemetry surfaces.

**Progress Note (Cross-Stack • 11 Apr):** Added audited shutdown coverage and `/auth/refresh` regression tests in Node while
  introducing Flutter widget/unit tests for the session bootstrapper and runtime health repository. Updated admin dashboard,
  Flutter splash/login copy, and design trackers so maintenance messaging and secure-session prompts remain consistent across
  surfaces.

**Progress Note (Cross-Stack • 12 Apr):** Hardened HTTP perimeter controls (helmet, trust proxy, compression, audited CORS), piped blocked-origin telemetry into `/api/admin/runtime/health`, extended the admin runtime panel with an API perimeter card, and updated Flutter maintenance messaging with backend support contacts to keep mobile alerts actionable.

**Progress Note (Cross-Stack • 15 Apr):** Activated the web application firewall, exporting WAF metrics to `/api/admin/runtime/health`, refreshing the admin runtime telemetry panel with rule/source analytics, and teaching Flutter runtime polling to raise security snackbars whenever new blocks occur. Task 1.3 security posture enhancements moved to production-ready status while integration and production scores improved through shared telemetry.

**Progress Note (Cross-Stack • 18 Apr):** Auto-block telemetry and UX shipped across backend, admin React, and Flutter, complete with integration tests validating middleware order and JWT enforcement. Task 1 security, completion, and production metrics climbed as automated quarantines now surface actionable countdowns and review guidance without manual log scraping.

**Progress Note (Backend • 16 Apr):** Refactored shutdown orchestration into a dedicated lifecycle helper that logs worker/database drain outcomes, updates runtime security audits, and guarantees connection draining executes even after upstream failures. Added targeted Jest coverage so graceful shutdown remains regression-safe and telemetry surfaces drain incidents for operations and mobile clients.

**Progress Note (Cross-Stack • 19 Apr):** Shipped the Prometheus exporter `/health/metrics` feed, admin panel monitoring card, and runtime incident runbook covering scrape recovery, rate-limit and WAF triage, and communication workflows. Compliance locker APIs now run through Zod validation with Supertest coverage, and Flutter clients raise exporter-stale alerts so mobile operators see the same telemetry as web. Task 1 security, integration, and production readiness climbed with shared monitoring and guardrails.

**Progress Note (Cross-Stack • 20 Apr):** Aligned documentation and design artefacts with the metrics exporter and compliance locker validation, updated progress trackers, and queued new test runs so Task 1 telemetry changes remain auditable. Backend/API/design change logs now reference `/health/metrics`, Prometheus runbooks, and the sanitised compliance flows, lifting Task 1 completion confidence without introducing placeholder content.

## Task 2 — Modularise domain models and align schemas (88%)

- **Design:** Update ERDs, taxonomy diagrams, and stakeholder documentation reflecting the modular architecture.

**Progress Note (Backend • 05 Apr):** Domain registry now partitions the 360-model monolith into audited contexts with dedicated auth, marketplace, and platform services orchestrating login audits, feature flags, and workspace synchronisation. Zod-backed schema generation publishes JSON contracts to `shared-contracts/domain`, enabling web and Flutter teams to consume canonical DTOs while migration rewrites and ERD deliverables move into planning.

**Progress Note (Backend • 06 Apr):** Published an authenticated `/api/domains` discovery surface that serialises bounded-context models, indexes, and associations for operators while exposing service bindings and sampled attributes. Generated TypeScript client definitions via `npm run schemas:clients` so React/Node tooling can ingest the same contracts as the JSON schema consumers.

**Progress Note (Cross-Stack • 23 Apr):** Delivered governance metadata across backend, React, and Flutter: `/api/domains/governance` + context detail endpoints aggregate steward contacts, retention policies, and review cadences; React admin dashboard renders remediation badges and review countdowns; Flutter admin card mirrors summaries with Riverpod providers; JSON schemas and TS clients regenerated; docs/design/test plans updated.
