# Version 1.50 Milestone Breakdown

## Milestone 1 – Harden Core Services & Security Perimeter (25%)
**Objective:** Resolve startup coupling, middleware defects, and security weaknesses identified across the issue list while delivering compliance scaffolding.

- **Task 1.1: Decouple service lifecycles and introduce health orchestration (60%)**
  - Establish independent worker containers with supervisor restarts and readiness probes for background jobs.
  - Implement graceful shutdown hooks that drain queues, close Sequelize pools, and flush logs.
  - Publish service health telemetry to structured logging and monitoring dashboards for observability.
  - Document failure scenarios and recovery runbooks for incident responders.
  - **Status 04 Apr:** Lifecycle orchestrator now supervises background workers, exposes `/health/live` and `/health/ready` endpoints, and records structured logs with correlation IDs. Remaining scope includes extending telemetry export to the monitoring stack and drafting incident runbooks.

  - Correct Express error-handler signatures and add fallback JSON serializers for unknown failures.
  - Enforce Celebrate/Zod schemas on every route, including pagination, filters, and payload limits.
  - Configure security middleware (Helmet, CORS whitelists, compression, body-size limits) with automated regression tests.
  - Update API documentation and SDK generation pipelines to match the validated contracts.
  - **Status 04 Apr:** Error handler upgraded with correlation-aware logging, payload limits and rate limiter configured, and `/health` documentation drafted. Schema validation rollout remains pending.
- **Task 1.3: Implement security posture enhancements (20%)**
