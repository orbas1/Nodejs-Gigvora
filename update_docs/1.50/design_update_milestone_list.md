# Version 1.50 Design Milestone Plan

## Milestone 1 – Foundations & Tokenisation (Week 1, 35% complete)
**Objectives:** Establish shared design language, audit current debt, and publish token libraries required for downstream work.

**Deliverables:**
- Color, typography, elevation, spacing, and motion tokens distributed to engineering repositories.
- Updated accessibility baseline report highlighting urgent parity gaps.
- Signed-off IA draft for mobile and web navigation.
- Applications/messaging/provider workspace flows documented with analytics instrumentation notes to mirror new persistence layer rollout.
- Reference dataset scenarios mapped to seeded backend tables so prototypes and QA flows surface production-grade states during reviews.
- Sanitised service payload matrix outlining fields exposed by the ORM-backed APIs, cache lifetimes, and associated UI messaging rules.
- Backend schema overview, ER diagram, and governance pack synchronised with automated tests to anchor design QA and compliance checkpoints.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/docs/schema-overview.md†L3-L52】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/docs/er-diagram.md†L1-L33】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/docs/data-governance.md†L3-L25】

**Entry/Exit Criteria:**
- Entry: Kick-off sign-off, access to legacy designs, compliance requirements captured.
- Exit: Tokens merged into design system, IA approved by product, accessibility backlog prioritised.

## Milestone 2 – Structural & Interaction Alignment (Weeks 2-4, 0% complete)
**Objectives:** Redefine layouts, navigation patterns, and widget inventories to support Version 1.50 flows.

**Deliverables:**
- Responsive grid specifications and component inventories for dashboards, chat, feed, and financial modules.
- Updated user/provider journey maps reflecting new IA and logic flow.
- Interaction pattern library covering form validation, states, and error handling.

**Entry/Exit Criteria:**
- Entry: Token library published, IA baseline approved.
- Exit: Blueprint packages handed to engineering with annotations; interaction patterns signed off by QA.

## Milestone 3 – Detailed Screen Authoring & Prototyping (Weeks 4-7, 0% complete)
**Objectives:** Produce high-fidelity, annotated screens and interactive prototypes for all critical workflows.

**Deliverables:**
- Annotated Figma boards for dashboards, messaging, feed, escrow, compliance, and enterprise modules.
- Clickable prototypes covering end-to-end cross-platform journeys.
- Content and localisation guidance appended to each screen.

**Entry/Exit Criteria:**
- Entry: Structural blueprints accepted, component kits available.
- Exit: Prototype approval from product, compliance, and engineering; content guidelines signed.

## Milestone 4 – Validation, QA & Implementation Support (Weeks 7-10, 0% complete)
**Objectives:** Validate usability, accessibility, and compliance; support engineering implementation and close gaps.

**Deliverables:**
- Usability test reports with prioritised recommendations and remediation plans.
- Accessibility conformance assessments (WCAG 2.1 AA) with issue tracking.
- Design QA checklist results, variance logs, and sign-off statements for release.

**Entry/Exit Criteria:**
- Entry: Prototypes validated, stakeholders aligned on scope.
- Exit: All P0/P1 design issues resolved or documented with mitigation; implementation handoff complete; release sign-off obtained.
