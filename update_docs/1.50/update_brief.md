# Version 1.50 – Update Brief

## Executive Overview
Version 1.50 evolves Gigvora into an enterprise-ready marketplace with hardened security perimeters, governed data models, and end-to-end financial and marketplace workflows. Informed by the Version 1.50 programme assets (`Update Plan.md`, `update_milestone_list.md`, `update_task_list.md`, and `update_progress_tracker.md`), this release coordinates backend, frontend, Flutter, and operational teams to remediate critical defects, unlock compliance capabilities, and deliver AI-enabled experiences with mobile parity. Every milestone is paired with cross-surface integration coverage and documented quality gates so development and QA move in lockstep from initial hardening through launch orchestration.

## Strategic Objectives
1. **Security & Reliability Reinforcement:** Decouple service lifecycles, implement enterprise middleware, and stand up observability plus incident response tooling to satisfy SLA and compliance commitments before new functionality lands.
2. **Governed Domain Architecture:** Modularise backend domains, align migrations and seeds, and distribute shared schema/SDK packages so all clients consume a single source of truth.
3. **Financial Integrity & Marketplace Completion:** Deliver multi-provider payments, wallet/dispute flows, and creation studio experiences tied to live dashboards and menu redesigns.
4. **Experience Modernisation:** Replace placeholder front-end/mobility layers with design system assets, messaging improvements, CMS-driven marketing, and localisation pipelines.
5. **Integrations, AI, & Parity:** Provide CRM/productivity integrations, AI provider fabric, and full mobile parity (user and provider apps) with runtime resilience and telemetry sanitisation.
6. **Quality & Release Governance:** Expand automated/manual testing, documentation, and release management so launch readiness is auditable and reversible.

## Scope Breakdown by Task
### Task 1 — Stabilise service lifecycles and security perimeters
- **Engineering:** Separate worker processes, implement readiness/liveness probes, enforce Celebrate/Zod validations, and instrument structured telemetry covering rate limiting, abuse detection, and maintenance messaging.
- **Data & API:** Harden database pooling and shutdown flows, expose updated OpenAPI contracts, and gate downstream logic when dependencies fail.
- **UX & QA:** Provide consistent maintenance copy/iconography, ensure health telemetry surfaces across admin channels, and confirm issue-list remediations via regression suites.

### Task 2 — Modularise domain models and align schemas
- **Backend:** Split monolithic model index into bounded contexts with domain service layers guarded by feature flags.
- **Shared Contracts:** Generate OpenAPI/JSON schemas, TypeScript, and Dart SDKs, replacing mock repositories across web and mobile clients.
- **Governance:** Rebuild migrations/seeds, produce ERDs/data dictionaries, and add data quality monitors with CI smoke tests against MySQL/PostgreSQL and SQLite.

### Task 3 — Enforce validation, consent, and governance workflows
- Deploy RBAC matrices, consent record tables, SAR tooling, and anonymisation jobs.
- Build consent/admin preference hubs across web and mobile, update policy documentation, and ensure localisation plus accessibility for legal surfaces.
- Validate GDPR exports and audit logging through API contract tests and manual verification.

### Task 4 — Complete financial, escrow, and dispute capabilities
- Integrate Stripe, Adyen, and PayPal adapters with secure credential management and reconciliation jobs.
- Implement dispute lifecycle tooling, review aggregation, fraud detection, and persona-aware dashboards.
- Refresh navigation/menus with real analytics widgets and CMS controls while meeting WCAG AA requirements.

### Task 5 — Deliver creation studio and marketplace experiences
- Ship multi-step creation wizards with autosave, collaborator invites, live feed ranking, and explorer enhancements.
- Automate bidding, invitations, scheduling, and automatching triggers, wiring notifications and documentation for persona hand-offs.
- Seed taxonomies/templates and ensure dashboards render live marketplace data instead of placeholders.

### Task 6 — Modernise frontend architecture and experience foundations
- Consolidate routing/auth guards, adopt React Query/SWR, bundle splitting, and secure session refresh flows.
- Produce design tokens, refactor UI components, publish Storybook/Chromatic libraries, and deliver CMS-driven marketing with localisation snapshots.
- Upgrade messaging/inbox systems, omnichannel notifications, preference hubs, and conduct usability testing rounds.

### Task 7 — Expand integration and AI fabric
- Launch OAuth onboarding, bi-directional sync jobs, retry queues, and admin observability panels for HubSpot, Salesforce, Slack, Google Drive, and GitHub.
- Create AI provider registry with quota enforcement, moderation, diagnostics, and opt-out transparency messaging.
- Blend integration/AI signals into automatching, notifications, and dashboards across all clients.

### Task 8 — Achieve mobile parity and runtime resilience
- Replace demo auth on Flutter apps with production flows, secure storage, offline caching, push notifications, crash/analytics instrumentation, and Fastlane pipelines.
- Deliver provider-specific dashboards, dispute responses, finance approvals, and automatching insights with localisation and accessibility parity.
- Optimise mobile API endpoints, database indexes, and state management for deterministic offline/online transitions.

### Task 9 — Institutionalise observability, tooling, and secret hygiene
- Deploy logging/metrics/tracing stacks, CI security scanning, Dependabot/Renovate, and vault-driven credential rotation.
- Instrument telemetry sanitisation, bundle analysis gates, crash reporting, analytics redaction, and backup verification across all surfaces.
- Produce operational dashboards, runbook templates, and training materials enabling rapid incident response.

### Task 10 — Execute testing, documentation, and release readiness
- Author backend unit/integration/load suites, frontend Jest/Cypress/visual regression pipelines, and Flutter widget/integration/device-farm plans.
- Run contract tests with partner sandboxes, validate migrations on multiple engines, and codify scenario-based QA scripts for marketplace, finance, integrations, and mobile parity flows.
- Update README/setup guides, produce governance artefacts, changelog entries, and end-of-update reports while rehearsing release/rollback drills.

## Milestones & Delivery Cadence
- **Milestone 1 – Harden Core Services & Security Perimeter:** Execute Tasks 1–3 prerequisites, standing up observability, middleware, consent/RBAC, and legal documentation foundations.
- **Milestone 2 – Modular Domain Architecture & Data Governance:** Complete Task 2 deliverables, align migrations/seeds, publish schemas/SDKs, and enable data lifecycle tooling.
- **Milestone 3 – Financial Integrity & Marketplace Workflows:** Advance Tasks 4–5, integrating payments, disputes, creation studio, and dashboard/menu redesigns.
- **Milestone 4 – Frontend Modernisation & Design System:** Realise Task 6 outputs, shipping design tokens, component library, messaging upgrades, and CMS localisation.
- **Milestone 5 – Integrations, AI Fabric, and Mobile Parity:** Fulfil Tasks 7–8 with CRM/AI integrations, mobile parity, telemetry sanitisation, and runtime resilience.
- **Milestone 6 – Quality Assurance, Documentation & Launch Readiness:** Wrap Tasks 9–10 by expanding test suites, operational tooling, training collateral, release orchestration, and post-launch monitoring.

Dependencies include vault/Redis infrastructure for security improvements, integration sandbox credentials, schema refactor buy-in across squads, and CI capacity for expanded automation. Risks will be mitigated via milestone-aligned readiness reviews and evidence captured in the tracker.

## Progress Tracking & Quality Gates
- The `update_progress_tracker.md` establishes baseline metrics (all 0%) across Security, Completion, Integration, Functionality, Error Free, and Production readiness for each task. Teams must update these weekly with supporting artefacts (test reports, dashboards, documentation links).
- QA and development collaborate through embedded integration coverage, ensuring backend, frontend, user app, provider app, database, API, logic, and design deliverables are verified per task definition.
- Security and governance controls must achieve measurable improvements (rate-limit telemetry, consent audit logs, vault rotation evidence) before downstream milestones unlock.
- Regression and contract testing pipelines serve as exit criteria for Milestones 3–6, alongside incident runbooks and release rehearsal sign-offs.

## Expected Outcomes
- Hardened service perimeter with documented incident response playbooks and real-time observability across platforms.
- Consistent, governed data models powering generated SDKs and eliminating mock data across web and mobile clients.
- Enterprise-grade financial and dispute tooling with reconciled ledgers, SLA-driven escalation, and persona dashboards.
- Modernised UX with unified design tokens, localisation, CMS-driven content, and performant messaging/notification systems.
- Integrated CRM/AI capabilities and mobile parity that maintain compliance, telemetry hygiene, and user trust.
- Comprehensive QA, documentation, and launch operations ensuring Version 1.50 ships with auditable readiness and reversible deployment strategies.
