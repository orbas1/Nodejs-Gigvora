# Release 1.50 Brief – Gigvora Platform

## Objective
Deliver full cross-surface parity across mobile, web, and admin experiences while graduating operational tooling for production readiness and enterprise onboarding.

## Key Enhancements
1. **Mobile Launch (v1.0.0)** – Android and iOS applications now ship with calendar, feed, explorer, finance, and settings parity. Offline support, localization, accessibility, and biometric security align with compliance requirements.
2. **Backend Hardening** – RBAC matrices, CORS allow-lists, and metrics labelling updated so mobile traffic is isolated for monitoring. Session metadata now captures device fingerprints for security audits.
3. **Admin Console Maturity** – Admin dashboards receive refreshed analytics, workflow automation, and trust & safety tooling to scale workspace onboarding without engineering intervention.
4. **Project Operations Dashboard** – Gig management workspace consolidates delivery health, backlog status, and team availability into a single console for programme managers.
5. **Commercial Readiness** – Pricing, valuation narratives, and go-to-market collateral (prelaunch valuation doc) updated to support investor and partner conversations.

## Quality & Testing
- Backend: `npm test` plus contract suites across services to guard against regressions.
- Web: React unit/integration suites executed with coverage thresholds enforced by CI.
- Mobile: `melos run ci:verify` (analyzer, widget, integration) and manual QA sweeps on representative devices.
- Observability: Synthetic checks against `/health` and `/readiness`, plus dashboards segmented by surface (`web`, `mobile`, `admin`).

## Rollout Strategy
- Stage → production promotion gated on automated health signals and manual approval from product, engineering, and compliance leads.
- Feature flags control incremental exposure (e.g., explorer filters, finance exports) to cohorts across channels.
- Runbooks updated for support and on-call engineers, detailing rollback, incident response, and communication cadences.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **High traffic launch windows:** Rate-limiting tuned and CDN caching primed to absorb spikes; real-time alerts configured.
- **Compliance audits:** Documentation refreshed (privacy, valuation, admin overview) and signed off by legal & data protection teams.
- **Mobile store approvals:** Pre-submission checklists completed, and a fallback release candidate is retained for emergency rollback.

## Next Steps
- Monitor telemetry for seven days post-launch; prioritise fixes exceeding error budget thresholds.
- Prepare 1.51 patch focusing on notification UX and expanded integrations.
- Continue stakeholder enablement with updated demos and sales collateral.
