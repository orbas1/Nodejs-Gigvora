# Gigvora Version 1.50 Update Brief

## Executive Summary
Version 1.50 advances the Gigvora platform from the Version 1.00 foundation plan into an execution-focused release that converts the hardening, data governance, and experience investments into fully realised, production-ready capabilities. Drawing on the Version 1.00 update plan, milestone roadmap, task breakdown, and progress tracker, this brief articulates the feature scope, integration responsibilities, and quality expectations that guide delivery.

The release concentrates on six coordinated workstreams:
1. **Platform Bootstrap & Security Hardening** – operational resilience upgrades that eliminate startup instability and secure health/configuration surfaces.
2. **Database Governance & Data Integrity** – compliance-focused schema retrofits, seed data, and contract alignment that support intelligent matching and analytics.
3. **Experience, Navigation & Policy Overhaul** – enterprise-grade UX, navigation, policy embedding, and Creation Studio Wizard 2.0.
4. **Community, Communication & Live Services** – Discord-level community chat, Chatwoot-powered inbox, moderation consoles, and live session telemetry.
5. **Intelligence, Monetisation & Dashboard Unification** – matching/recommendation pipelines, ads marketplace, finance-enabled dashboards, and internal model governance.
6. **Cross-Platform QA & Release Governance** – CI/CD parity, accessibility/performance validation, deployment automation, and documentation sign-off.

Each stream inherits cross-surface integration mandates (backend, front-end, user and provider mobile apps, database, API, logic, design) and decomposes into 30 subtasks tracked in the Version 1.00 progress matrix.

## Release Vision & Value
- **Reliability as a Baseline:** Address 100+ platform issues by rebuilding lifecycle management, authenticated observability, deterministic configuration, and secure storage practices so every persona experiences consistent uptime.
- **Data Confidence & Insight:** Deliver transactional integrity, hashed secrets, OTP expirations, and seed datasets that unlock analytics, matching accuracy, and compliance reporting while aligning web/mobile contracts.
- **Unified Multichannel Experience:** Elevate navigation, dashboards, and creation workflows to enterprise polish, ensuring policies are surfaced, acknowledged, and searchable across devices.
- **Real-Time Collaboration:** Provide community chat, live sessions, and unified inbox experiences with moderation tooling and telemetry to support high-concurrency events.
- **Revenue & Intelligence Growth:** Launch explainable matching, recommendation, and ads services with internal model governance and finance integration embedded within every dashboard.
- **Release Discipline:** Institutionalise CI/CD gates, automated/manual testing coverage, deployment scripts, and reporting artefacts to enable confident go/no-go decisions and regulatory compliance.

## Scope Overview by Workstream
### 1. Platform Bootstrap & Security Hardening
- Single-state boot pipeline coordinating database pools, dependency guard caches, and worker orchestration.
- Authenticated health/readiness endpoints with queue depth, dependency pagination, and structured outage codes.
- Schema-validated configuration console, environment linting, and hardened CSP/correlation policies.
- Operator runbooks, observability dashboards, and CI gates enforcing environmental parity.

### 2. Database Governance & Data Integrity
- Transactional migrations with hashed secrets, OTP expirations, foreign-key rules, and MySQL-safe JSON strategies.
- Seed data packs for personas, categories, and starter content powering explorers and matching services.
- Schema snapshots, checksum validation scripts, and shared-contract regeneration covering backend, React, and Flutter clients.
- Backup/restore automation, encryption-at-rest guidance, and ownership governance.

### 3. Experience, Navigation & Policy Overhaul
- Design system refresh across React and Flutter with WCAG 2.2 AA compliance and responsive breakpoints.
- Mega menu navigation, timeline rename, contextual footers, and per-role dashboards with code-splitting.
- Restyled pages featuring LinkedIn-level polish, contextual recommendations, and secure session handling.
- Policy/legal content integration with acknowledgement tracking, SEO metadata, and creation studio scoring telemetry.

### 4. Community, Communication & Live Services
- Socket.io infrastructure for role-based channels, voice/video rooms, event scheduling, and moderation heuristics.
- Chatwoot bubble synchronised with dashboard inboxes, conversation routing, SLA escalations, and analytics.
- Moderation dashboards with audit trails, spam/bad-word detection, and governance workflows.
- Live service telemetry instrumentation, incident playbooks, and resilience testing under load.

### 5. Intelligence, Monetisation & Dashboard Unification
- Matching engine pipelines with explainability overlays and feedback loops.
- Recommendation and ads services with placement controls, budget pacing, fraud detection, and internal model registry.
- Finance-enabled dashboards, unified project/gig workspaces, and automation triggers for CRM/kanban flows.
- Monitoring, A/B testing frameworks, and rollback toggles ensuring safe experimentation.

### 6. Cross-Platform QA & Release Governance
- Automated test expansion (unit, integration, E2E, load, security, financial, mobile) gated in CI across monorepo packages.
- Manual persona walkthroughs, accessibility audits, device farm sessions, and resilience drills.
- Deployment scripting/UI for provisioning, migrations, seeding, smoke tests, rollbacks, and monitoring dashboards.
- Documentation package completion: README/full guides, policy publications, starter data catalogs, incident runbooks, change_log.md, end_of_update_report.md, upload_brief.md.

## Integration Responsibilities
- **Backend:** Execute lifecycle refactors, API extensions, scoring services, finance modules, and integration guards.
- **Front-end (Web):** Implement redesign, navigation, chat/inbox components, finance dashboards, and runtime configuration UX.
- **User Phone App:** Achieve parity for design, navigation, chat, matching, finance, and secure storage while adding readiness signals.
- **Provider Phone App:** Mirror user app enhancements with provider-specific monetisation, moderation, and workspace tooling.
- **Database:** Deliver migrations, seeders, governance automation, and telemetry instrumentation.
- **API & Shared Contracts:** Regenerate SDKs, align headers/ports, version health/readiness endpoints, and document changelog impacts.
- **Logic/Intelligence:** Configure heuristics, internal models, explainability, A/B testing, and rollback strategies within infrastructure constraints.
- **Design:** Provide comprehensive UX/UI assets, accessibility criteria, and QA checklists to validate each persona experience.

## Quality & Progress Expectations
- Baseline progress stands at 0% across all 6 tasks and 30 subtasks per the Version 1.00 tracker; incremental updates must record improvements across Security, Completion, Integration, Functionality, Error Free, and Production dimensions.
- Milestones 1–5 structure the delivery cadence, each with explicit entry/exit criteria to control risk and guarantee readiness before advancing.
- Weekly status reviews will reference tracker metrics, milestone burndown, and risk mitigation actions to maintain release discipline.

## Deliverable Alignment
- Each workstream outputs implementation artefacts, test suites, and documentation updates referenced in the update plan.
- Final release package for Version 1.50 must include validated deployments, passing test matrices, approved documentation, and compiled changelog/end-of-update reports ready for stakeholder distribution.

By adhering to this brief, teams can coordinate complex feature delivery with the necessary remediation and governance to ship Version 1.50 as a secure, compliant, and enterprise-ready evolution of Gigvora.
