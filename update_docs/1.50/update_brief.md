# Version 1.50 – Update Brief

## Executive Summary
Version 1.50 positions Gigvora as a unified, production-grade marketplace spanning web, Flutter mobile, and enterprise experiences. The release knits together seven end-to-end delivery tracks that collectively harden security, expand data foundations, unlock communication and discovery features, embed FCA-aligned financial workflows, introduce enterprise-grade project tooling, mature QA and release governance, and finalize mobile application readiness for both user and provider personas. The update closes pre-existing authentication, schema, and compliance gaps while layering the new feature slate captured in the feature brief and roadmap addenda.

## Release Objectives
- **Secure the platform core:** Complete Task 1 to deliver resilient authentication, RBAC, biometric support, and security monitoring, eliminating current login failures and compliance risks before any new features are exposed.
- **Expand persistent data foundations:** Execute Task 2 migrations, seeding, and ORM updates to support feeds, messaging, analytics, and enterprise objects referenced across every feature theme.
- **Unlock engagement and discovery:** Advance Task 3 to stand up omnichannel chat, live feeds, MeiliSearch-backed discovery, and AI-assisted workflows that drive marketplace liquidity and community growth.
- **Deliver compliant financial workflows:** Implement Task 4 escrow, dispute, and trust scoring enhancements to meet FCA obligations while increasing transparency for all transaction stakeholders.
- **Introduce enterprise-grade modules:** Complete Task 5 to give agencies, companies, and launchpad cohorts robust project, contest, and ATS tooling that differentiates Gigvora for B2B adoption.
- **Institutionalize quality & release governance:** Deliver Task 6 automation, CI/CD, documentation, and beta feedback loops to guarantee observability and readiness for launch.
- **Finalize mobile production readiness:** Fulfill Task 7 to consolidate Flutter architecture, drive device-lab quality, and prepare App Store / Play Store submissions so mobile users receive day-one parity.

## Milestone Structure & Timeline
Version 1.50 executes across five sequential milestones that guide cross-functional coordination and exit criteria.
1. **Milestone 1 – Security Foundations & Schema Enablement (Weeks 1-4):** Complete Tasks 1, 2 (subtasks 1-4), and early Task 6 automation to unblock downstream development. Exit requires MFA-hardened auth, validated migrations, and CI smoke coverage.
2. **Milestone 2 – Engagement & Discovery Enablement (Weeks 4-8):** Activate Task 3 experiences, finish Task 2 client integrations, and expand QA planning. Exit depends on real-time messaging validation, search relevance, and accessibility audits.
3. **Milestone 3 – Compliance, Trust & Enterprise Workflows (Weeks 8-12):** Deliver Task 4 and Task 5 (subtasks 1-4) plus documentation deliverables. Exit criteria include FCA certification artifacts, dispute UAT, and enterprise usability sign-off.
4. **Milestone 4 – Mobile Application Completion & Store Readiness (Weeks 12-15):** Focus on Task 7, mobile-facing portions of Task 3 and Task 6, and performance optimization. Exit requires device farm regressions, localization verification, and store submission packages.
5. **Milestone 5 – Launch Readiness & Production Transition (Weeks 15-16):** Consolidate Task 5 usability iterations, Task 6 go-live governance, and Task 7 rollout support. Exit mandates full-system regression, production rehearsal, and stakeholder sign-off.

## Task Breakdown & Integration Coverage
Each of the seven tasks is decomposed into 4–5 subtasks with mandated integration coverage across backend, front-end, user/provider mobile, database, API, logic, and design disciplines. Completion requires not only functional delivery but also associated artifacts such as regression scripts, moderation policies, compliance evidence binders, usability reports, and release checklists. Integration testing spans the entire stack, with parity sign-offs ensuring web and Flutter experiences remain synchronized.

## Quality & Progress Tracking
The progress tracker establishes seven metrics—security, completion, integration, functionality, error-free, production, and overall averages—for every task and subtask, providing fine-grained visibility during execution. Teams must update percentages as work progresses, using the aggregate view to monitor release health and gating milestone exits. QA strategies incorporate automated unit, integration, performance, accessibility, localization, and device-farm testing across milestones, anchored by the governance schedule defined in the update plan.

## Dependencies & Cross-Team Coordination
- **Design & UX:** Supply blue-themed design tokens, screen specs, and accessibility annotations to maintain brand consistency across web and Flutter surfaces.
- **Backend & Data:** Deliver schema migrations, service layers, analytics pipelines, and observability hooks that underpin chat, feed, escrow, and enterprise modules.
- **Compliance & Legal:** Review escrow, dispute, and data governance artifacts; participate in FCA dry runs and DPIAs before milestones 3 and 5 exit gates.
- **Support & Marketing:** Coordinate beta programs, help-center materials, store listings, and launch communications aligned with Task 6 and Task 7 deliverables.

## Success Metrics & Reporting
Success will be measured through usability pass rates, engagement uplift, compliance outcomes, and adoption metrics outlined in the feature brief, all of which rely on timely completion of milestones and tasks plus the end-of-update reporting mandated in Task 6. Weekly release councils and bi-weekly demos will use tracker data to surface risks, while the final go/no-go checklist consolidates progress, open issues, and post-launch monitoring plans.

## Next Steps
Kickoff Milestone 1 by finalizing engineering assignments, validating security requirements with compliance, and initializing CI pipelines per Task 6. Maintain continuous tracker updates to ensure the Version 1.50 release remains on schedule and achieves the unified, mobile-ready marketplace vision documented across the planning artifacts.
