# Widget Updates â€” User App (11 Apr 2024)

- **Runtime Health Banner:** Added a lightweight banner widget used on the splash/login flow that surfaces maintenance
  messaging and links to the status page returned by the backend telemetry. The banner respects theme tokens and accessibility
  contrast guidance captured in `Design_Plan.md`.
- **Session Restore Indicator:** Implemented a determinate progress bar and status label that reflects the refresh-token call
  state (polling, refreshing, retrying). The widget emits analytics breadcrumbs so ops can trace where refresh attempts fail.
- **Error Toast Harmonisation:** Updated toast variants to reuse the `SecureSessionExpired` copy block and error severity so
  mobile, web, and admin surfaces communicate outages consistently.
