# Build & QA Updates â€” User App (11 Apr 2024)

- Added unit/widget tests for the session bootstrapper and runtime health repository. The new suites document refresh-token
  success/failure flows and readiness fallbacks, providing regression coverage before the Flutter CI lane is restored.
- Documented the requirement to provide `AuthTokenStore.useDriver` overrides in tests so secure storage can be simulated during
  local runs without Hive dependencies.
