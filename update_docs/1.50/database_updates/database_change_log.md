# Database Change Log â€” Version 1.50 Update

## 23 Apr 2024
- Created `domain_governance_reviews` table to persist governance audit outcomes,
  remediation notes, steward contacts, and next-review cadences for every bounded
  context. Indexed `contextName`, `reviewStatus`, and `nextReviewDueAt` to power
  dashboard filters and overdue review alerts.
- Seeded baseline governance reviews so staging/test environments surface
  realistic remediation backlogs and audit history when the new governance
  endpoints are consumed by dashboards or policy automation.

## 13 Apr 2024
- Added `database_audit_events` table capturing lifecycle events (`startup`, `shutdown_initiated`, `shutdown_failed`) with initiator, reason, and JSON metadata storing pool telemetry for compliance review.

## 10 Apr 2024
- Created `runtime_announcements` table storing maintenance messaging with indexed `status`, `startsAt`, and `endsAt` columns so
  scheduled windows can be queried efficiently for public and admin endpoints.
- Persisted `audiences` and `channels` as JSON/JSONB arrays (dialect aware) plus `metadata` document for arbitrary key/value
  pairs, enabling downstream services to render targeted copy without schema churn.
- Added slug uniqueness constraint (`slug` unique index) to prevent duplicate announcements and keep cache keys deterministic.

## Historical Notes
- Earlier Version 1.50 entries covered lifecycle and domain registry changes; see prior weeks for detail.
