# Version 1.50 Design Change Log (Enterprise Detail)

## Overview
- **Scope:** Consolidates UI/UX decisions across the Application Design Update Plan and Web Application Design Update workstreams housed under `ui-ux_updates/Design_Task_Plan_Upgrade`.
- **Drivers:** Resolve parity gaps between marketing, authenticated web hubs, and native apps; incorporate feedback from agency/provider personas; prepare for theme switching and modular page composition (including partial-driven layouts and emo-theme packs).
- **Research Inputs:** Combined analysis of `Screens_Update_Plan.md`, `Screens_update_images_and_vectors.md`, `Logic_Flow_map.md`, and web assets documentation produced during Version 1.50 discovery.
- **Rollout:** Sequenced through design QA gates prior to sprint integration, with staged publication of tokens to engineering repositories (React, Node API docs, Flutter kit).

## 07 Apr 2024 — Runtime Health Operations Suite
1. **Admin Runtime Panel:** Documented the new runtime health section in `Dashboard Designs.md` and `Screens_Updates_widget_functions.md`, covering readiness badges, dependency chips, rate-limit utilisation bars, and history cards tied to `/api/admin/runtime/health`.
2. **Telemetry Copy & Localisation:** Finalised operations copy decks and localisation strings for rate-limit alerts and refresh messaging in `Screen_text.md` and `text.md.md`, aligning with Compliance UX (Task 9) requirements.
3. **Polling Patterns:** Added interaction notes to `component_functions.md` describing manual refresh affordances, background polling cadence, and accessibility expectations (status messages, focus management) for telemetry widgets.

## 06 Apr 2024 — Domain Observability Surfaces
1. **Registry Dashboards:** Added admin/operator dashboard panels in `Dashboard Designs.md` and `Screens_Updates_widget_functions.md` that consume the `/api/domains/registry` payload, surfacing bounded-context coverage, service bindings, and schema drift alerts.
2. **Schema Tooling Hand-off:** Updated `Architecture_Domain_Map.md` and `Design Plan.md` to reference the new TypeScript contract outputs so design-to-code traceability covers both JSON and TS client packages.
3. **Documentation Nodes:** Extended `Design_update_task_list.md` Task 7 notes and `Design_update_progress_tracker.md` commentary to include observability KPIs and UI affordances for domain drill-down modals.

## 05 Apr 2024 — Domain Architecture Alignment
1. **Context Maps:** Documented auth, marketplace, finance, and platform bounded contexts in `Architecture_Domain_Map.md` to align visual ERDs with the new backend domain registry. Provided legend updates in `Design Plan.md` for cross-team traceability.
2. **Feature Flag UI Hooks:** Added feature flag management wireframes in `Dashboard Designs.md` and `component_functions.md` covering rollout percentages, audience targeting, and audit history surfaces.
3. **Workspace Synchronisation States:** Updated project/workspace diagrams in `Screens_Update_Logic_Flow_map.md` to reflect automated workspace status mirroring, including blocked/completed badge treatments.

## 04 Apr 2024 — Maintenance & Security Experience Refresh
1. **Telemetry Dashboards:** Added operator-facing health widgets and downtime banners to admin dashboards, mapping to the new backend `/health/ready` payload. Specifications captured in `Dashboard Designs.md` and `Screens_Updates_widget_functions.md` include latency trend cards, worker roster chips, and rate-limit notifications.
2. **Maintenance Messaging System:** Documented copy decks, iconography, and localisation patterns for maintenance mode, partial outages, and security advisories. Assets referenced in `Screen_text.md`, `text.md.md`, and `Screens_update_images_and_vectors.md` now include neutral and emo-theme treatments plus legal-approved escalation language.
3. **Session Bootstrap UX:** Updated onboarding and re-authentication flows in `Organisation_and_positions.md` and `Settings Dashboard.md` to surface health state, retry timers, and safe-fail guidance across web and mobile personas.
4. **Design QA Hooks:** Extended `Design_update_progress_tracker.md` scoring notes to incorporate maintenance banner regression tests and accessibility checks for high-contrast downtime modes.

## Global Design Decisions
### Tokens & Foundations
1. **Colour Tokens:** Revalidated Gigvora Indigo palette with expanded semantic aliases (`surface-muted`, `surface-inverse`, `cta-emo`) to support both neutral and emo-inspired themes requested by marketing. The new alias map is propagated to SCSS/Tailwind builds (`Colours.md`, `colours.md`).
2. **Typography Scale:** Rebalanced heading/body pairings per `Fonts.md` to ensure consistent vertical rhythm across dashboards, wizards, and CMS-driven pages. Added fallback stacks for low-latency rendering on emerging markets devices.
3. **Spacing Grid:** Standardised 8pt grid with overlay guidelines for cards, menus, and modal shells. The layout spec extends to partial templates used on the home page, preventing drift between `Home page components.md` and `Screens_list.md` assets.
4. **Iconography & Illustration:** Adopted the refreshed 2px stroke icon pack and vector set defined in `images_and_vectors.md` and `Screens_update_images_and_vectors.md`. Emo-theme friendly accent illustrations leverage gradient overlays configurable through CMS theme toggles.

### Interaction Patterns
- **Navigation Harmonisation:** All menus (per `Menus.md`, `Menus.md.md`) now follow a left-anchored mega-menu for desktop, condensed drawer for mobile. Added persona-aware shortcuts and analytics instrumentation for path tracking.
- **State Management:** Buttons, chips, and cards expose rest/hover/focus/pressed/loading/disabled states using shared token definitions. Inline validation and toast system updates documented in `Screen_buttons.md` and `Forms.md` unify feedback loops.
- **Theme Switching:** Introduced dynamic theme payload structure allowing runtime swaps between core, high-contrast, and emo palettes. Partial templates expose `theme-slot` placeholders so marketing can release event skins without redeploying code.

## Platform-Specific Highlights
### Application (Cross-Platform Authenticated Experiences)
- **Screen Hierarchy Refresh:** `Screens_Update.md` and `Screens_list.md` reorganise dashboards by persona. Prioritised mission-critical widgets (payouts, gig pipeline) at top-left positions as noted in `Organisation_and_positions.md`.
- **Widget & Component Enhancements:** `Screens_Updates_widget_functions.md` and `Screens__Update_widget_types.md` align functional behavior (filters, sorting, contextual actions) across provider/user panels. Widgets now expose analytics hooks and AI-surface placeholders.
- **Forms & Dummy Data:** Reinforced form validation patterns with stateful hints (`Forms.md`, `Dummy_Data_Requirements.md`) to reduce QA rework. Placeholder datasets reflect realistic finance/compliance states for staging demos.
- **Logic Flow Updates:** `Logic_Flow_map.md` and `Logic_Flow_update.md` illustrate revised routing, factoring in theme selection entry points, partial-based page assembly, and cross-navigation to newly introduced studios.
- **Accessibility & Inclusivity:** `Screen_text.md` and `Screen_update_Screen_colours.md` enforce minimum contrast and inclusive phrasing. Added copy variants for neurodiverse support cues requested by the accessibility council.

### Web Application (Marketing & Responsive Hub)
- **Home Page Redesign:** `Home Page Organisations.md` and `Home page components.md` orchestrate hero segmentation, pricing matrix, testimonial carousel, and CTA stacking. Emo-theme toggles introduce festival/event-specific skins while keeping base layout accessible.
- **Pages Catalogue:** `Pages_list.md` and `pages.md` expand marketing footprint (Community, Careers, Compliance Center). Partial fragments allow content operations to compose new pages rapidly using predefined component types.
- **Dashboard Shell:** `Dashboard Designs.md` and `Dashboard Organisation.md` restructure authenticated web dashboards with modular cards, quick filters, and theme-aware backgrounds. `Scss.md` codifies responsive breakpoints.
- **Profile & Settings:** `Profile Look.md`, `Profile Styling.md`, and `Settings Dashboard.md` deliver coherent identity presentation, including new badge ribbons and compliance prompts.
- **Buttons & Component Functions:** `buttons.md.md` and `component_functions.md` formalise button hierarchies, motion specs, and component-level API integration, aligning with the application plan to reduce divergence.

## Logic & Flow Adjustments
- **Workflow Harmonisation:** Combined updates from `Logic_Flow_map.md` (web) and `Screens_Update_Logic_Flow_map.md` (application) ensure multi-step journeys (onboarding, gig creation, dispute management) maintain consistent gating logic and progress indicators.
- **Theme-Responsive Routing:** Added guard rails for theme-specific experiences to prevent broken states when emo themes are disabled for compliance events. Documented fallback partials to maintain structural integrity.
- **Content Personalisation:** Enhanced dynamic slotting for testimonials, hero cards, and dashboard announcements. Logic now supports partial-based AB testing and future AI-driven placement recommendations.

## Asset & Content Updates
- **Imagery:** Updated hero, dashboard, and empty state assets with vector-driven compositions referenced in `images_and_vectors.md`. Provided guidelines for asset compression and CDN layering.
- **Copywriting:** Refreshed copy frameworks for marketing CTAs, product navigation labels, and compliance messaging per `text.md.md` and `Screen_text.md`. Included tone variations for professional vs. emo-themed campaigns.
- **Data Visualisations:** Added chart palettes, legend behaviors, and layout grids to `Cards.md.md` and `Cards.md`, ensuring dashboards meet data storytelling targets.

## QA & Governance
- **Design QA Checklist:** Established verification matrix across web and app assets covering layout parity, theme toggles, accessibility contrast, responsive breakpoints, and partial rendering integrity.
- **Security & Compliance:** Documented handling of consent banners, legal text modules, and secure profile states. Added security overlays for high-risk flows (finance, identity upload) referencing `Settings.md` guidelines.
- **Handoff Deliverables:** Generated Figma, Zeplin, and token JSON packages. Provided engineering-ready annotations for React, Blade, and Flutter implementations, referencing CSS/SCSS guidelines.

## Outstanding Items
1. Validate emo-theme assets against final WCAG audit before public launch.
2. Complete screenshot regression sweeps on partial-based home page variants across viewport sizes.
3. Prototype new community/event pages using partial assembly to ensure theme toggle compatibility.
4. Extend typography tokens to cover high-density finance tables and analytics overlays.
5. Monitor telemetry from beta release to refine navigation order for agency-heavy workflows.
