## Detailed Updates
### Application (Flutter) Ecosystem
- **Structure & Navigation:**
  - Unified dashboard blueprint merges feed, projects, and financial snapshots with segmented controls for user/provider roles.
  - Modal navigation for transactional flows replaces stacked screens to reduce user backtracking.
  - Tablet layout now uses adaptive columns and collapsible drawers to preserve readability.
- **Visual System:**
  - Color tokens defined for primary, accent, semantic states and applied consistently to cards, forms, and alerts.
  - Elevation and shadow guidance refined to emphasise actionable cards and reduce glare on dark backgrounds.
  - Illustrations converted to SVG/Flare sources to support dynamic theming without quality loss.
- **Interaction Model:**
  - Buttons adopt shared sizing and icon alignment rules across platforms; destructive actions gated behind confirmation modals.
  - Forms now include inline validation, helper text slots, and error summarisation at submission.
  - Floating action buttons limited to creation contexts; secondary actions moved into contextual menus.
- **Typography & Content:**
  - Updated type scale aligns with accessibility targets (≥ 4.5:1), ensuring headings use Inter SemiBold and body copy Manrope Regular.
  - Content guidelines set truncation, ellipsis, and line clamp behaviour for multi-language support.
  - Empty state copy reauthored to emphasise next steps and support automation prompts.

### Web Application Ecosystem
- **Information Architecture:**
  - Global navigation reorganised: Dashboard, Projects, Marketplace, Messaging, Compliance, Settings with persona-specific quick links.
  - Secondary navigation introduced for workspace-specific filters and KPI toggles.
  - Notification centre now anchored to header with prioritised alerts and action shortcuts.
- **Surface Enhancements:**
  - Live feed tiles conform to new card specification and include inline moderation controls.
  - Chat drawer supports multi-thread switching, presence indicators, and offline messages.
  - Search results adopt grid and list toggle with improved skeleton states for perceived performance.
- **Compliance & Trust Overlays:**
  - Escrow workflows feature timeline progress, dispute badges, and trust score chips for clarity.
  - Accessibility adjustments include focus-visible outlines, label associations, and reflow testing down to 320px.
  - Financial pages now reference compliance callouts and secure messaging prompts.

### Cross-Platform Alignment & Governance
- Established shared design tokens, grid spacing units (4px base), and iconography sets for parity.
- Created QA checklist for design sign-off, covering color contrast, touch target sizing, focus order, and localisation verifications.
- Documented rollback path and component regression tests to ensure design changes remain auditable through release candidate builds.

## Approval & Versioning
- **Design Authority:** Lead Product Designer (UI/UX) – accountable for enforcing token updates and component library parity.
- **Review Cadence:** Weekly cross-functional design reviews with engineering, QA, and compliance, logging decisions in the design tracker.
- **Version Control:** Updates tagged per feature module (e.g., `design/v1.50/app-navigation`) with annotated exports stored in the design repository and linked to Jira tickets for traceability.
