## Global Design Decisions
### Tokens & Foundations
1. **Colour Tokens:** Revalidated Gigvora Indigo palette with expanded semantic aliases (`surface-muted`, `surface-inverse`, `cta-emo`) to support both neutral and emo-inspired themes requested by marketing. The new alias map is propagated to SCSS/Tailwind builds (`Colours.md`, `colours.md`).
2. **Typography Scale:** Rebalanced heading/body pairings per `Fonts.md` to ensure consistent vertical rhythm across dashboards, wizards, and CMS-driven pages. Added fallback stacks for low-latency rendering on emerging markets devices.
3. **Spacing Grid:** Standardised 8pt grid with overlay guidelines for cards, menus, and modal shells. The layout spec extends to partial templates used on the home page, preventing drift between `Home page components.md` and `Screens_list.md` assets.
4. **Iconography & Illustration:** Adopted the refreshed 2px stroke icon pack and vector set defined in `images_and_vectors.md`and `Screens_update_images_and_vectors.md`. Emo-theme friendly accent illustrations leverage gradient overlays configurable through CMS theme toggles.

### Interaction Patterns
- **Navigation Harmonisation:** All menus (per `Menus.md`, `Menus.md.md`) now follow a left-anchored mega-menu for desktop, condensed drawer for mobile. Added persona-aware shortcuts and analytics instrumentation for path tracking.
- **State Management:** Buttons, chips, and cards expose rest/hover/focus/pressed/loading/disabled states using shared token definitions. Inline validation and toast system updates documented in `Screen_buttons.md` and `Forms.md` unify feedback loops.
- **Theme Switching:** Introduced dynamic theme payload structure allowing runtime swaps between core, high-contrast, and emo palettes. Partial templates expose `theme-slot` placeholders so marketing can release event skins without redeploying code.

## Platform-Specific Highlights
### Application (Cross-Platform Authenticated Experiences)
- **Screen Hierarchy Refresh:** `Screens_Update.md` and `Screens_list.md` reorganise dashboards by persona. Prioritised mission-critical widgets (payouts, gig pipeline) at top-left positions as noted in `Organisation_and_positions.md`.
- **Widget & Component Enhancements:** `Screens_Updates_widget_functions.md` and `Screens__Update_widget_types.md` align functional behavior (filters, sorting, contextual actions) across provider/user panels. Widgets now expose analytics hooks and AI-surface placeholders.
- **Forms & Dummy Data:** Reinforced form validation patterns with stateful hints (`Forms.md`, `Dummy_Data_Requirements.md`) to reduce QA rework. Placeholder datasets reflect realistic finance/compliance states for staging demos.
- **Logic Flow Updates:** `Logic_Flow_map.md` and `Logic_Flow_update.md` illustrate revised routing, factoring in theme selection entry points, partial-based page assembly, and cross-navigation to newly introduced studios.
- **Accessibility & Inclusivity:** `Screen_text.md` and `Screen_update_Screen_colours.md` enforce minimum contrast and inclusive phrasing. Added copy variants for neurodiverse support cues requested by the accessibility council.

### Web Application (Marketing & Responsive Hub)
- **Home Page Redesign:** `Home Page Organisations.md` and `Home page components.md` orchestrate hero segmentation, pricing matrix, testimonial carousel, and CTA stacking. Emo-theme toggles introduce festival/event-specific skins while keeping base layout accessible.
- **Pages Catalogue:** `Pages_list.md` and `pages.md` expand marketing footprint (Community, Careers, Compliance Center). Partial fragments allow content operations to compose new pages rapidly using predefined component types.
- **Dashboard Shell:** `Dashboard Designs.md` and `Dashboard Organisation.md` restructure authenticated web dashboards with modular cards, quick filters, and theme-aware backgrounds. `Scss.md` codifies responsive breakpoints.
- **Profile & Settings:** `Profile Look.md`, `Profile Styling.md`, and `Settings Dashboard.md` deliver coherent identity presentation, including new badge ribbons and compliance prompts.
- **Buttons & Component Functions:** `buttons.md.md` and `component_functions.md` formalise button hierarchies, motion specs, and component-level API integration, aligning with the application plan to reduce divergence.

## Logic & Flow Adjustments
- **Workflow Harmonisation:** Combined updates from `Logic_Flow_map.md` (web) and `Screens_Update_Logic_Flow_map.md` (application) ensure multi-step journeys (onboarding, gig creation, dispute management) maintain consistent gating logic and progress indicators.
- **Theme-Responsive Routing:** Added guard rails for theme-specific experiences to prevent broken states when emo themes are disabled for compliance events. Documented fallback partials to maintain structural integrity.
- **Content Personalisation:** Enhanced dynamic slotting for testimonials, hero cards, and dashboard announcements. Logic now supports partial-based AB testing and future AI-driven placement recommendations.

## Asset & Content Updates
- **Imagery:** Updated hero, dashboard, and empty state assets with vector-driven compositions referenced in `images_and_vectors.md`. Provided guidelines for asset compression and CDN layering.
- **Copywriting:** Refreshed copy frameworks for marketing CTAs, product navigation labels, and compliance messaging per `text.md.md` and `Screen_text.md`. Included tone variations for professional vs. emo-themed campaigns.
- **Data Visualisations:** Added chart palettes, legend behaviors, and layout grids to `Cards.md.md` and `Cards.md`, ensuring dashboards meet data storytelling targets.

## QA & Governance
- **Design QA Checklist:** Established verification matrix across web and app assets covering layout parity, theme toggles, accessibility contrast, responsive breakpoints, and partial rendering integrity.
- **Security & Compliance:** Documented handling of consent banners, legal text modules, and secure profile states. Added security overlays for high-risk flows (finance, identity upload) referencing `Settings.md` guidelines.
- **Handoff Deliverables:** Generated Figma, Zeplin, and token JSON packages. Provided engineering-ready annotations for React, Blade, and Flutter implementations, referencing CSS/SCSS guidelines.

## Outstanding Items
1. Validate emo-theme assets against final WCAG audit before public launch.
