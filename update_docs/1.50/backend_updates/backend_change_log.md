# Backend Change Log â€” Version 1.50 Update

## 04 Apr 2024
- Introduced a lifecycle orchestrator that separates the Express HTTP server from long-running workers, adds graceful shutdown hooks, and publishes readiness/liveness telemetry for platform monitoring.
- Hardened request processing with correlation-aware structured logging, configurable body-size limits, and global rate limiting to contain abuse and simplify incident response.
- Added health reporting services that verify Sequelize connectivity, aggregate worker state, and expose `/health/live` plus `/health/ready` endpoints for load balancers and mobile clients.
- Refreshed background worker management so the profile engagement and news aggregation jobs can be started, stopped, and observed independently of the HTTP runtime.
