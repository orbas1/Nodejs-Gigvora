# API Changes â€” Version 1.50 Update

## Health & Telemetry Endpoints
- Added `GET /health/live` returning lightweight process and HTTP runtime status for container orchestrators.
- Added `GET /health/ready` returning dependency-aware readiness reports, including database latency metrics and worker states. Responses emit `503` when dependencies degrade.
- Maintained `GET /health` as an alias of the readiness endpoint for backwards compatibility with existing load balancer checks.

## Request Governance
- Enforced configurable JSON/urlencoded body limits via `REQUEST_BODY_LIMIT` to guard against oversized payload attacks.
- Applied rate limiting across `/api/*` routes using `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS` and `RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS` to mitigate brute-force and scraping behaviours.
- Standardised correlation headers by echoing `X-Request-Id` on every response, enabling cross-service traceability in logs and monitoring dashboards.
