# API Integration Changes â€” Version 1.50 Update

- Platform integrations, load balancers, and mobile clients must update health probes to call `GET /health/ready` to benefit from dependency-aware signals. Legacy `/health` continues to respond but now mirrors the readiness payload.
- Observability stacks should ingest the enriched readiness JSON (including worker roster and database latency) to power uptime dashboards referenced in the operations playbook.
- Internal tooling and admin dashboards can query `GET /api/domains/registry` and related endpoints to validate schema coverage, cross-check migration plans, and hydrate documentation portals with live metadata.
- Admin tooling, support dashboards, and mobile clients must integrate with `/api/runtime/maintenance` and `/api/admin/runtime/maintenance` to display downtime messaging. Ensure caching respects 60-second TTL and propagate `If-None-Match` headers for efficient polling.
- Partner SDK pipelines and documentation portals should fetch `/api/docs/runtime-security` during build to stay aligned with the published health/auth contract; honour the five-minute cache headers and ETag to avoid unnecessary downloads.
- Admin dashboards, SOC tooling, and automated abuse detectors should parse the new `waf` block summaries returned by `/api/admin/runtime/health` to trigger alerts when block volume spikes or new rules start firing.
- Consumers of `/api/admin/runtime/health` should read `waf.autoBlock` to surface active quarantines, expose next review timestamps, and coordinate automated unblocking workflows when TTLs expire.
