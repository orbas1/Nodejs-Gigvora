# Build & Deployment Updates â€” Version 1.50

- Node backend start/stop scripts now expose `start()` and `stop()` helpers for test harnesses and operational tooling; production processes should monitor `/health/ready` before routing traffic.
- Container probes should be updated to call `GET /health/live` for liveness and `GET /health/ready` for readiness with a failure threshold aligned to worker bootstrap time (~15s).
- New environment variables (`REQUEST_BODY_LIMIT`, `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS`, `RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS`, `LOG_LEVEL`) should be injected through deployment manifests with environment-specific overrides.
- Logging pipelines must ingest structured JSON output from Pino; ensure log shippers parse the `requestId` and `worker` fields for correlation dashboards.
- Add `npm run schemas:sync` to CI to regenerate `shared-contracts/domain` artifacts whenever domain schemas evolve; distribute generated JSON to front-end and Flutter package registries as part of release automation.
- Introduce a companion CI step `npm run schemas:clients` so TypeScript definitions in `shared-contracts/clients/typescript` stay aligned with the JSON schema source of truth.
- Install the `compression` package for the Node API and ensure container images include the dependency so the new HTTP security middleware can emit compressed responses by default.
- Surface `TRUST_PROXY` configuration in deployment manifests (e.g., `loopback`, numeric hop counts) so Express recognises upstream load balancers when resolving client IPs and enforcing secure cookies.
- Apply `npx sequelize-cli db:migrate` during deployment to create `runtime_announcements`; missing table will cause new maintenance endpoints to fail with `500`.
- Update CI pipelines to run `npm test -- services/runtimeMaintenanceService` once optional dependencies (`zod`) are installed or stubbed to cover new lifecycle logic.
