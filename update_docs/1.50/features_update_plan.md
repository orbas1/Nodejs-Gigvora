   - Integrate chat bubble into web SPA and Flutter app with presence indicators and push notifications.
2. **Live Feed Launch**
   - Implement feed service (posts, likes, comments, shares) with moderation tools and rate limiting.
   - Build UI components for feed composer, media uploads, and share dialogs (projects, gigs, companies, volunteers, profiles).
   - Enable follow system integration with notifications and personalization algorithms.
3. **Gigvora Ads Suite**
   - Build advertiser onboarding, budget management, and campaign configuration flows.

   - Develop admin oversight tools (manual holds, refunds, reporting exports) and user-facing escrow dashboards.
2. **Dispute Resolution Upgrade**
   - Extend dispute data model with multi-stage workflow (startup, offers, mediation, arbitration).
   - Provide UI for parties to submit offers, evidence, and arbitration payments; add automated reminders.
   - Integrate mediation scheduling and escalation logic with support tooling.
3. **Profile Trust Enhancements**
   - Add new profile sections (agency/company type, qualifications, experience, references, areas).
   - Implement trust score algorithm factoring verification, reviews, completion rates, and community engagement.
   - Surface likes, follows, follower counts, and profile view toggles; ensure API + Flutter parity.

## Phase 4 – Discovery & Matching
1. **MeiliSearch Global Search**
   - Index projects, gigs, jobs, profiles, agencies, volunteers with structured filters and synonyms.
   - Build advanced search UI (filter panels, saved searches, Boolean queries) on web and Flutter.
   - Implement analytics and relevance tuning with A/B experimentation.
2. **Freelancer Auto-Assign & Experience Launchpad**
   - Design auto-assign rules engine (criteria, rotation, acceptance/decline flows) with notification triggers.
   - Extend Experience Launchpad models for onboarding, criteria matching, and automated next-stage progression.
   - Create dashboards for clients to monitor matches, adjust criteria, and override assignments.
3. **Volunteer Hub Expansion**
   - Build volunteer listing module with availability toggles, skill tags, and invitation workflow.
   - Integrate volunteer opportunities into search and live feed; support accept/reject flows across platforms.

## Phase 5 – Projects, Jobs, and Enterprise Users
1. **Project Management Module**
   - Implement budgets, allocations, timelines, tasks, objectives, milestones, time tracking, and in-project chat.
   - Support group projects and agency escalation paths; integrate with escrow and auto-assign.
   - Deliver dashboards and reports for progress tracking and approvals.
2. **Contest Projects**
   - Create contest creation wizard with timing, prize distribution, and prepaid escrow rules.
   - Provide participant submission flows, judging tools, and cancellation safeguards (first 50% window).
3. **Agency & Company User Types**
   - Introduce role-based dashboards for HR, payment distribution, gig/job/project management.
   - Enable team management (members, permissions), invoicing, and analytics tailored to each user type.
4. **Employment & Jobs Board**
   - Build full ATS pipeline (job listings, applications, screening, interview scheduling, stage tracking).
   - Support CV builder/upload, company-branded job pages, and internal collaboration tools.
   - Integrate with Experience Launchpad and volunteer flows for cross-promotion.

## Phase 6 – Quality Assurance & Launch
1. **Comprehensive QA**
   - Draft test cases covering web, Flutter, API, and backend services, including regression and performance tests.
   - Execute automated test suites (unit, integration, end-to-end) and record coverage metrics.
   - Conduct FCA compliance audit, security penetration testing, and data privacy review.
2. **Beta & Feedback Loop**
   - Run closed beta with select users (clients, freelancers, agencies) to gather usability feedback.
   - Iterate on UX, performance, and bug fixes based on beta findings.
3. **Launch Readiness**
   - Prepare documentation, release notes, in-app guides, and support training.
   - Coordinate marketing campaign, app store submission updates, and phased rollout with monitoring dashboards.
4. **Post-Launch Monitoring**
   - Track key metrics (escrow success, feed engagement, search performance) daily for first 30 days.

## Deliverables & Ownership
- **Product/Design:** Finalized UX/UI specs, component libraries, copy guidelines.
- **Engineering:** Implemented features, API documentation, deployment scripts.
- **QA/Compliance:** Test reports, FCA certification evidence, security assessments.
- **Support/Marketing:** Help center articles, onboarding materials, promotional assets.

## Dependencies & Sequencing Notes
- Escrow compliance must be signed off before contests, auto-assign payouts, and agency/company payment distributions go live.
- MeiliSearch infrastructure must be operational before advanced search, Experience Launchpad matching, and volunteer discovery can proceed.
- Flutter parity checks must occur at each milestone to avoid regressions at launch.
