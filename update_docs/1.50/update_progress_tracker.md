**Progress Note (Cross-Stack • 19 Apr):** Prometheus exporter now serves `/health/metrics`, admin dashboards surface exporter health, and the new runtime incident runbook documents scrape recovery and perimeter triage. Compliance locker endpoints are covered by Zod validation with dedicated Supertest coverage, and Flutter clients raise telemetry alerts when scrapes are stale. Task 1 security, integration, and production maturity increased through unified monitoring and guardrail enforcement.

**Progress Note (Cross-Stack • 20 Apr):** Backend/API documentation, route inventories, and design trackers now reference the metrics exporter, `/health/metrics` contract, and compliance locker validation. Progress trackers updated to reflect operational readiness uplift, and new test suites plus runbook entries are queued for execution to keep Task 1 telemetry changes auditable end-to-end.

**Progress Note (Cross-Stack • 23 Apr):** Domain governance metadata landed end-to-end—Node API exposes governance summaries and
context drill-downs, React admin dashboards surface remediation counts and steward
contacts, Flutter home screen mirrors the backlog, and shared contracts published
typed clients. Documentation, design artefacts, and progress trackers updated; remaining
work focuses on HTTP integration tests and React/Flutter widget coverage for the new views.

**Progress Note (Cross-Stack • 10 Apr):** Runtime maintenance registry delivered with CRUD APIs, observability integration, and Flutter client consumption. Security raised via audience targeting/severity enforcement, completion/integration scores improved by cross-surface delivery, and production readiness increased through migration plus test automation.

**Progress Note (Cross-Stack • 07 Apr):** Runtime telemetry is now captured end-to-end via the in-process rate limiter metrics, `/api/admin/runtime/health` aggregation service, and the admin dashboard runtime panel. Operators can trace dependency degradation, rate-limit saturation, and historical spikes from a single surface, lifting Task 1 production readiness.

**Progress Note (Backend • 08 Apr):** Shared Zod schemas now protect authentication and admin settings routes via the new `validateRequest` middleware, normalising inputs, emitting structured validation errors, and blocking unsafe configuration payloads. Task 1 security, completion, integration, and production scores rose accordingly.

**Progress Note (Backend • 09 Apr):** Validation now covers search discovery, saved-search subscriptions, project creation/update, and finance control tower routes, canonicalising categories, geo viewports, numeric limits, and ISO dates while new Jest suites document the sanitised contracts.

**Progress Note (Backend • 12 Apr):** Guard-focused supertests now verify `/api/compliance/documents` and `/api/users/:id` surface dependency-driven `503` responses with correlation IDs when storage or payments degrade, increasing Task 1 security, functionality, and error-free metrics.

**Progress Note (Backend • 13 Apr):** Database pools now publish metrics into readiness/observability responses, shutdown hooks persist `database_audit_events`, and HTTP stop sequences drain Sequelize connections before exiting. Task 1 production and integration maturity rose as maintenance playbooks can confirm graceful draining.
**Progress Note (Backend • 10 Apr):** Finance and compliance services now gate requests on critical dependency telemetry (`paymentsCore`, `complianceProviders`, and database health) with new runtime guards, preventing ledger corruption during Stripe/Escrow outages. Platform settings updates immediately resynchronise dependency health so `/health/ready` and admin dashboards surface custodial readiness without manual intervention.

**Progress Note (Cross-Stack • 11 Apr):** Backend regression tests now cover `/api/auth/refresh` and the lifecycle shutdown path while Flutter widget/unit suites validate session bootstrap and runtime health fallbacks. Design, documentation, and admin UI updates ensure maintenance messaging, audit logging, and refresh-token prompts stay consistent across web and mobile clients.

**Progress Note (Cross-Stack • 12 Apr):** Delivered perimeter-aware HTTP security middleware, added compressed/audited CORS responses, exposed blocked-origin telemetry via `/api/admin/runtime/health`, refreshed the admin runtime panel with perimeter analytics, and aligned Flutter maintenance messaging with backend support contacts to keep users informed during downtime.

**Progress Note (Backend • 14 Apr):** Published the hashed `/api/docs/runtime-security` OpenAPI contract, normalised readiness telemetry to include pooled connection snapshots, and refactored runtime observability to summarise scheduled maintenance and security events. Task 1 security, integration, and production scores rose as operators and client teams now share a single documented contract for health/auth flows with automated caching guidance.

**Progress Note (Cross-Stack • 15 Apr):** Deployed the in-process web application firewall, surfaced WAF telemetry in `/api/admin/runtime/health`, updated the admin runtime panel with rule/source analytics, and wired Flutter runtime polling to raise security alerts when new blocks occur. Task 1 security, functionality, integration, and production metrics increased thanks to unified abuse detection across backend, web, and mobile.

**Progress Note (Cross-Stack • 17 Apr):** Web application firewall now enforces threat signatures before controllers, exports metrics into `/api/admin/runtime/health`, and updates web/mobile clients with abuse telemetry so operators can investigate blocks without tailing logs.

**Progress Note (Cross-Stack • 18 Apr):** Automated WAF quarantines landed with configurable thresholds/TTLs, enriched telemetry in `/api/admin/runtime/health.waf.autoBlock`, admin UI updates showing countdowns, and Flutter snackbar variants—lifting Task 1 security/completion metrics and aligning SOC runbooks with the new schema.

**Progress Note (Backend • 16 Apr):** Consolidated shutdown sequencing into a dedicated orchestrator that logs worker, HTTP, and database drain verdicts while guaranteeing connection draining executes even when upstream steps fail. New Jest coverage validates drain failure propagation and audit logging, lifting Task 1 security, completion, and error-free confidence scores.

**Critical Observations**
1. **Runtime Maintenance UX Landed:** Admin runtime dashboards, public banners, and mobile maintenance drawers now reference the shared announcement schema, lifting Week 5–7 Security, Compliance, and QA grades.
2. **Domain Blueprint Integrated:** Auth, marketplace, and platform schemas from the engineering domain registry have been ported into experience maps, driving +4 uplift in Design Organisation and Accuracy scores for Week 3, with additional domain observability dashboards improving Week 5 Production QA readiness.
3. **Security Messaging Advancing:** Maintenance/downtime specs plus the runtime telemetry operations copy elevated the Security Grade to 80; final legal approval on payout escalations and RBAC copy is still pending alongside icon updates for WAF event states.
4. **Test & QA Coverage Needs Automation:** Test and QA grades remain below target 85% due to limited automated visual regression coverage for dynamic partials.
5. **Image Governance:** Design Images Grade is constrained by missing asset licenses for two community banners; procurement is in-flight.
6. **Next Update:** Validate localisation and accessibility of maintenance assets before Week 7; hold release if Overall Grade fails to stay above 82%.

## Action Items
1. Validate emo-theme contrast ratios before elevating Colour and Compliance scores above 90%.
2. Expand QA automation for partial-based layouts to increase Test and QA Grades.
3. Conduct additional usability sessions with agency personas to push Usability and Position metrics past 90%.
4. Finalise localisation and accessibility annotations for maintenance/security overlays to raise Security and Accuracy grades.
5. Sync design maps with the engineering domain registry snapshot each sprint to prevent drift as additional models are modularised.
6. Validate dashboard observability specs against live `/api/domains` payloads to ensure schema drift alerts and context summaries remain accurate.
