**Progress Note (Cross-Stack • 10 Apr):** Runtime maintenance registry delivered with CRUD APIs, observability integration, and Flutter client consumption. Security raised via audience targeting/severity enforcement, completion/integration scores improved by cross-surface delivery, and production readiness increased through migration plus test automation.

**Progress Note (Cross-Stack • 07 Apr):** Runtime telemetry is now captured end-to-end via the in-process rate limiter metrics, `/api/admin/runtime/health` aggregation service, and the admin dashboard runtime panel. Operators can trace dependency degradation, rate-limit saturation, and historical spikes from a single surface, lifting Task 1 production readiness.

**Progress Note (Backend • 08 Apr):** Shared Zod schemas now protect authentication and admin settings routes via the new `validateRequest` middleware, normalising inputs, emitting structured validation errors, and blocking unsafe configuration payloads. Task 1 security, completion, integration, and production scores rose accordingly.

**Progress Note (Backend • 09 Apr):** Validation now covers search discovery, saved-search subscriptions, project creation/update, and finance control tower routes, canonicalising categories, geo viewports, numeric limits, and ISO dates while new Jest suites document the sanitised contracts.

**Progress Note (Backend • 12 Apr):** Guard-focused supertests now verify `/api/compliance/documents` and `/api/users/:id` surface dependency-driven `503` responses with correlation IDs when storage or payments degrade, increasing Task 1 security, functionality, and error-free metrics.

**Progress Note (Backend • 13 Apr):** Database pools now publish metrics into readiness/observability responses, shutdown hooks persist `database_audit_events`, and HTTP stop sequences drain Sequelize connections before exiting. Task 1 production and integration maturity rose as maintenance playbooks can confirm graceful draining.

## Update Guidance
- **Security Level:** Reflects penetration, governance, and compliance hardening progress.
- **Completion Level:** Tracks overall delivery of subtasks within the associated plan item.
- **Integration Level:** Measures cross-system connectivity readiness (backend ↔ clients ↔ external partners).
- **Functionality Level:** Captures working feature coverage verified via demos or automated tests.
- **Error Free Level:** Represents defect burndown, regression results, and log/monitoring cleanliness.
- **Production Level:** Indicates deployment readiness, including infrastructure, runbooks, and launch approvals.
- **Overall Level:** Calculated as the average of the six preceding percentages to simplify executive reporting.

**Critical Observations**
1. **Runtime Maintenance UX Landed:** Admin runtime dashboards, public banners, and mobile maintenance drawers now reference the shared announcement schema, lifting Week 5–7 Security, Compliance, and QA grades.
2. **Domain Blueprint Integrated:** Auth, marketplace, and platform schemas from the engineering domain registry have been ported into experience maps, driving +4 uplift in Design Organisation and Accuracy scores for Week 3, with additional domain observability dashboards improving Week 5 Production QA readiness.
3. **Security Messaging Advancing:** Maintenance/downtime specs plus the runtime telemetry operations copy elevated the Security Grade to 80; final legal approval on payout escalations and RBAC copy is still pending alongside icon updates for WAF event states.
4. **Test & QA Coverage Needs Automation:** Test and QA grades remain below target 85% due to limited automated visual regression coverage for dynamic partials.
5. **Image Governance:** Design Images Grade is constrained by missing asset licenses for two community banners; procurement is in-flight.
6. **Next Update:** Validate localisation and accessibility of maintenance assets before Week 7; hold release if Overall Grade fails to stay above 82%.

## Action Items
1. Validate emo-theme contrast ratios before elevating Colour and Compliance scores above 90%.
2. Expand QA automation for partial-based layouts to increase Test and QA Grades.
3. Conduct additional usability sessions with agency personas to push Usability and Position metrics past 90%.
4. Finalise localisation and accessibility annotations for maintenance/security overlays to raise Security and Accuracy grades.
5. Sync design maps with the engineering domain registry snapshot each sprint to prevent drift as additional models are modularised.
6. Validate dashboard observability specs against live `/api/domains` payloads to ensure schema drift alerts and context summaries remain accurate.
