## Update Guidance
- **Security Level:** Reflects penetration, governance, and compliance hardening progress.
- **Completion Level:** Tracks overall delivery of subtasks within the associated plan item.
- **Integration Level:** Measures cross-system connectivity readiness (backend ↔ clients ↔ external partners).
- **Functionality Level:** Captures working feature coverage verified via demos or automated tests.
- **Error Free Level:** Represents defect burndown, regression results, and log/monitoring cleanliness.
- **Production Level:** Indicates deployment readiness, including infrastructure, runbooks, and launch approvals.
- **Overall Level:** Calculated as the average of the six preceding percentages to simplify executive reporting.
