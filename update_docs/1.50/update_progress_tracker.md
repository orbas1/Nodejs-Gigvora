# Version 1.50 Progress Tracker

Percentages reflect initial baseline before execution. Update the tracker weekly or at each major delivery checkpoint.

**Progress Note (Cross-Stack • 07 Apr):** Runtime telemetry is now captured end-to-end via the in-process rate limiter metrics,
`/api/admin/runtime/health` aggregation service, and the admin dashboard runtime panel. Operators can trace dependency degradati
on, rate-limit saturation, and historical spikes from a single surface, lifting Task 1 production readiness.

**Progress Note (Backend • 08 Apr):** Shared Zod schemas now protect authentication and admin settings routes via the new `vali
dateRequest` middleware, normalising inputs, emitting structured validation errors, and blocking unsafe configuration payloads.
Task 1 security, completion, integration, and production scores rose accordingly.

**Progress Note (Backend • 09 Apr):** Validation now covers search discovery, saved-search subscriptions, project creation/update, and finance control tower routes, canonicalising categories, geo viewports, numeric limits, and ISO dates while new Jest suites document the sanitised contracts.

**Progress Note (Backend • 10 Apr):** Finance and compliance services now gate requests on critical dependency telemetry (`paymentsCore`, `complianceProviders`, and database health) with new runtime guards, preventing ledger corruption during Stripe/Escrow outages. Platform settings updates immediately resynchronise dependency health so `/health/ready` and admin dashboards surface custodial readiness without manual intervention.

**Progress Note (Cross-Stack • 11 Apr):** Backend regression tests now cover `/api/auth/refresh` and the lifecycle shutdown path while Flutter widget/unit suites validate session bootstrap and runtime health fallbacks. Design, documentation, and admin UI updates ensure maintenance messaging, audit logging, and refresh-token prompts stay consistent across web and mobile clients.

## Update Guidance
- **Security Level:** Reflects penetration, governance, and compliance hardening progress.
- **Completion Level:** Tracks overall delivery of subtasks within the associated plan item.
- **Integration Level:** Measures cross-system connectivity readiness (backend ↔ clients ↔ external partners).
- **Functionality Level:** Captures working feature coverage verified via demos or automated tests.
- **Error Free Level:** Represents defect burndown, regression results, and log/monitoring cleanliness.
- **Production Level:** Indicates deployment readiness, including infrastructure, runbooks, and launch approvals.
- **Overall Level:** Calculated as the average of the six preceding percentages to simplify executive reporting.

## Supplemental UI/UX Design Metrics
Refer to `Design_update_progress_tracker.md` for detailed scoring across design-specific metrics. The summary below provides the latest checkpoint statuses to integrate with programme reporting.

| Checkpoint | Target Week | Design Quality % | Design Organisation % | Design Position % | Design Text Grade % | Design Colour Grade % | Design Render Grade % | Compliance Grade % | Security Grade % | Design Functionality Grade % | Design Images Grade % | Design Usability Grade % | Bugs-less Grade % | Test Grade % | QA Grade % | Design Accuracy Grade % | Overall Grade % | Δ vs Prior |
|------------|-------------|------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------------|------------------|------------------------------|----------------------|------------------------|------------------|-------------|-----------|-------------------------|----------------|-----------|
| Prototype Integration & Partial QA | Week 5 | 77 | 75 | 73 | 76 | 81 | 74 | 69 | 66 | 76 | 79 | 80 | 71 | 65 | 63 | 74 | 73 | +3 |
| Pre-Handoff QA Readiness | Week 6 | 83 | 81 | 79 | 82 | 85 | 80 | 76 | 73 | 82 | 84 | 85 | 77 | 71 | 69 | 80 | 79 | +6 |
| Launch Readiness Audit | Week 7 | 84 | 81 | 78 | 83 | 85 | 82 | 80 | 78 | 83 | 83 | 84 | 76 | 72 | 70 | 82 | 81 | +4 |

**Key Follow-Ups:**
- Close remaining design QA gaps on theme permutations before release.
- Elevate Test and QA Grades by integrating automated visual regression coverage for partial-based pages.
- Address outstanding security annotations on finance, identity, and maintenance overlays to push Security Grade above 80%.
