# Version 1.50 Design Plan

## Purpose
Detail the holistic design intent for Version 1.50 across application and web experiences, translating the granular artefacts in `ui-ux_updates/Design_Task_Plan_Upgrade` into an actionable execution blueprint for engineering, product, and QA teams.

## Strategic Goals
1. **Unify Cross-Surface Experiences:** Deliver a consistent Gigvora brand journey spanning marketing site, authenticated dashboards, and mobile apps using the refreshed token architecture.
2. **Enable Theme Agility:** Support neutral, high-contrast, and emo-inspired themes through dynamic token aliases, partial-driven layouts, and CMS-configurable slots without code redeployments.
3. **Boost Operational Clarity:** Elevate persona dashboards (user, provider, agency, admin) with mission-critical widgets, intuitive navigation, and actionable insights.
4. **Reduce Design-to-Code Friction:** Provide comprehensive specifications, logic flows, and asset packages to minimise ambiguity during implementation and QA.

## Design Principles
- **Accessibility First:** Maintain WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, enlarge touch targets, enforce contrast ratios, and supply keyboard-first interaction flows.
- **Modular Composition:** Compose screens from reusable partials/components documented in `Screens_Update.md`, `component_types.md`, and `Home page components.md` to accelerate future page creation.
- **Data Rich yet Focused:** Use cards, tables, and charts sparingly, emphasising clarity and highlighting key metrics. Align data visuals across dashboards with the guidelines in `Cards.md` and `Dashboard Designs.md`.
- **Personalised Journeys:** Leverage persona-specific navigation, contextual onboarding, and tailored messaging to guide users through creation, finance, and compliance workflows.
- **Theme Resilience:** Ensure every template gracefully handles theme swaps, fallback assets, and partial overrides while preserving readability and brand recognition.

## Workstreams
### 1. Foundations & Tokens
- Publish updated colour, typography, spacing, elevation, and motion tokens to shared design libraries (Figma) and engineering packages.
- Document alias usage for theme variations, including emo theme overlays, in `Colours.md`/`colours.md` and SCSS token exports.
- Align iconography and vector assets via `images_and_vectors.md`, ensuring consistent rendering across dark/light backgrounds.

### 2. Application Experience Overhaul
- Re-map screen hierarchy using `Screens_list.md` and `Organisation_and_positions.md` so each persona sees the most relevant data above the fold.
- Refresh widget interactions per `Screens_Updates_widget_functions.md`, `Screens__Update_widget_types.md`, and `Screen_buttons.md`.
- Align forms with validation patterns and progressive disclosure (`Forms.md`, `Dummy_Data_Requirements.md`).
- Harmonise logic flows based on `Logic_Flow_map.md`, `Logic_Flow_update.md`, and `Screens_Update_Logic_Flow_map.md` to ensure navigation consistency.
- Introduce maintenance telemetry cards, downtime banners, and retry guidance for admin/agency dashboards reflecting `/health/ready` insights; specifications captured in `Dashboard Designs.md` and `Screen_text.md`.
- Map bounded-context ownership in UI artefacts by updating `Architecture_Domain_Map.md` and in-product ERDs so dashboard widgets reference the new auth/marketplace/platform domains.

### 3. Web Application Modernisation
- Redesign marketing landing pages guided by `Home Page Organisations.md`, `Home page text.md`, and `Home page images.md`.
- Expand secondary pages (Community, Compliance, Careers) using the modular structures described in `pages.md` and `Pages_list.md`.
- Standardise dashboards (`Dashboard Designs.md`) and profile/settings experiences (`Profile Look.md`, `Settings Dashboard.md`) with theme-aware backgrounds.
- Define reusable component functions and placements referencing `component_functions.md` and `Placement.md`.
- Document maintenance and security messaging modules (status badges, rate-limit callouts, downtime toasts) for marketing and authenticated shells, ensuring localisation packs include required strings and icons.

### 4. Theme & Partial Infrastructure
- Implement theme toggles surfaced in settings and landing experience, referencing the alias map and partial documentation.
- Audit partial-based page assembly to ensure theme compatibility, referencing `Home page components.md` and `component_types.md`.
- Introduce event-driven emo theme kits with curated imagery, copy tone adjustments, and security/compliance validation.
- Ensure maintenance banners inherit theme tokens (neutral, high-contrast, emo) with accessibility validation and publish QA scripts covering downtime permutations.

### 5. Governance, QA, and Handoff
- Produce QA checklists mapping to each screen and theme combination, including screenshot diff runs and accessibility audits.
- Capture documentation for security overlays, consent messaging, and compliance banners (`Settings.md`, `Function Design.md`).
- Deliver developer handoff packages containing redlines, token JSON, component usage guidelines, and logic flow diagrams.

## Deliverables & Artefacts
- **Design Tokens:** JSON/SCSS exports for colours, typography, spacing, elevation.
- **Screen Blueprints:** Annotated wireframes for each persona, derived from `Screens_Update_Plan.md` and `Screens_Update.md`.
- **Component Library:** Updated catalogue covering buttons, cards, forms, navigation, modals, charts, and partial layouts.
- **Theme Kits:** Core, high-contrast, and emo theme bundles with imagery, copy guidelines, and QA scripts.
- **Documentation:** Logic flow diagrams, accessibility checklists, compliance copy templates, and partial composition guides.

## Cross-Functional Dependencies
- **Engineering:** Requires updates to React component library, Node templates (Blade/Handlebars), and Flutter widgets to support new tokens and layouts.
- **Product:** Aligns roadmap priorities with milestone sequencing and ensures stakeholders approve theme rollouts.
- **QA:** Needs updated regression suites for visual diffs, accessibility validation, and partial/theme permutations.
- **Marketing/Content:** Supplies new copy, imagery, and event-specific assets for emo themes and new landing pages.

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Theme conflicts introduce unreadable combinations | High | Automated contrast testing, fallback theme enforcement, editorial review of emo kits |
| Partial templates diverge between marketing and app shells | Medium | Centralise partial definitions, share component tokens, enforce linting on layout templates |
| Late copy/asset delivery delays QA | Medium | Establish content freeze dates, provide placeholder tokens, maintain copy doc in shared workspace |
| Accessibility regressions on new dashboards | High | Embed accessibility QA in milestone acceptance, involve external auditors |
| Inconsistent implementation across platforms | High | Supply code-ready documentation, align review rituals, and track implementation parity dashboards |

## Timeline & Governance
- **Design Freeze:** 10 June 2024
- **Engineering Handoff:** Rolling, final package 12 June 2024
- **QA Regression Window:** 13–24 June 2024
- **Release Readiness Review:** 25 June 2024
- **Stakeholder Checkpoints:** Weekly triads, bi-weekly design critiques, monthly accessibility council sync.

## Success Metrics
- Reduced navigation confusion (target: <5% "can't find" support tickets).
- Increased gig completion rates (+15% for mobile creation flow, +10% provider onboarding success).
- Improved accessibility audit scores (0 critical issues, ≤3 minor findings per release).
- Faster theme deployment (≤2 days from asset delivery to live preview).

## Next Steps
1. Finalise milestone scheduling in `Design_update_milestone_list.md`.
2. Align engineering backlog entries with `Design_update_task_list.md` subtasks.
3. Populate `Design_update_progress_tracker.md` weekly to maintain visibility.
4. Coordinate with marketing for emo theme content finalisation and QA scheduling.
5. Draft onboarding documentation for content authors using partial-driven page builder.
