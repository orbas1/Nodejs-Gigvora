# Version 1.50 Update Plan

## 1. Situation Analysis
- **Feature expansion mandates:** Version 1.50 introduces a production Flutter app, unified communication, FCA-compliant escrow, discovery automation, enterprise workflows, and infrastructure upgrades outlined in the new feature brief and feature plan.【F:update_docs/1.50/new_feature_brief.md†L4-L161】【F:update_docs/1.50/Features_to_add.md†L4-L78】
- **Critical issues to resolve:** Authentication is non-functional, data models are incomplete, APIs leak sensitive data, tooling is inconsistent, and security/compliance controls are missing per the pre-update evaluations.【F:update_docs/1.50/pre-update_evaluations/issue_report.md†L4-L60】【F:update_docs/1.50/pre-update_evaluations/issue_list.md†L3-L12】
- **Recommended fixes:** Authentication lifecycle hardening, schema expansion, API enablement, tooling alignment, and security reinforcement are prescribed in the fix suggestions and must be sequenced with new capabilities.【F:update_docs/1.50/pre-update_evaluations/fix_suggestions.md†L4-L53】
