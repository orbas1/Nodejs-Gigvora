# Version 1.50 Update Plan Overview

This executive companion summarises the detailed `update_plan.md`, milestone roadmap, task list, and tracker for Version 1.50. It consolidates the mandatory feature expansions, remediation actions, and quality gates derived from:
- **New Feature Brief:** Enterprise security, compliance, financial stewardship, integrations, experience overhaul, and mobile parity requirements.
- **Features Update Plan:** Seven-phase delivery schedule covering security, architecture, finance, experience, integrations, mobile parity, and quality assurance.
- **Features to Add Matrix:** Requirement IDs 35–146 spanning backend, web, and Flutter capabilities.
- **Issue Report & Issue List:** Critical deficiencies in backend lifecycle management, schema drift, mock data usage, mobile demo shortcuts, and absent tooling.
- **Fix Suggestions:** Thirty targeted remediation strategies across backend stabilisation, data governance, frontend readiness, mobile hardening, and operations.

## Strategic Goals
1. **Enterprise Reliability & Security:** Decouple service lifecycles, repair middleware, enforce validation, and deploy observability/incident response so SLAs and compliance commitments are met.
2. **Data & Domain Integrity:** Modularise models, align migrations, and publish shared schemas so every surface consumes consistent, governed data.
3. **Financial & Marketplace Completion:** Deliver payment providers, wallet/dispute flows, creation studio, dashboards, and live feed experiences promised to stakeholders.
4. **UX, Integrations, and Mobile Parity:** Modernise frontend architecture, ship design system assets, provide integration/AI fabric, and harden Flutter apps for enterprise use.
5. **Quality, Documentation, and Release Readiness:** Expand automated/manual testing, publish operational runbooks, finalise legal/marketing collateral, and orchestrate a controlled launch.

## High-Level Execution Threads
- **Task Workstreams:** Ten cross-functional tasks (security, modularisation, governance, finance, marketplace, frontend foundation, integrations, mobile parity, observability, QA/release) each with dedicated integration coverage for backend, frontend, user app, provider app, database, API, logic, and design.
- **Milestones:** Six milestones sequenced from security hardening through launch readiness, each containing 4–5 granular tasks with measurable outputs and dependencies.
- **Progress Tracking:** Multi-dimensional tracker recording security, completion, integration, functionality, error-free, production, and overall readiness percentages for every task.

## Governance & Reporting
- Weekly steering updates reference `update_progress_tracker.md` and milestone burndown.
- Cross-discipline leads own integration testing coverage: backend, frontend, user app, provider app, database, API, logic, design.
- Documentation deliverables include changelog updates, end-of-update report drafts, QA evidence, and compliance artefacts to satisfy enterprise audits.

## Next Steps
1. Kick off Milestone 1 with dedicated squads for backend security, consent governance, and observability instrumentation.
2. Stand up shared schema/tooling pipelines prior to feature work to avoid rework in downstream milestones.
3. Align QA, security, and compliance leads on acceptance criteria for each task before development begins.
4. Update the tracker at the end of each sprint and attach supporting evidence (test runs, dashboards, documentation links).
