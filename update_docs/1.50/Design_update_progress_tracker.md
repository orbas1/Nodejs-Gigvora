# Version 1.50 Design Update Progress Tracker

Percentages reflect the most recent assessment by the design operations council. Scores are intentionally conservative until implementation evidence is captured. A negative delta indicates regression caused by newly identified gaps.

## Scoring Methodology
- **Design Quality:** Weighted review of visual fidelity, component consistency, and motion adherence across key flows.
- **Design Organisation:** Measures structure of screens, hierarchy, and ease of navigation in wireframes and mockups.
- **Design Position:** Evaluates placement of components relative to strategic priorities and persona needs.
- **Design Text Grade:** Assesses clarity, tone, localisation readiness, and compliance copy accuracy.
- **Design Colour Grade:** Validates palette usage, contrast ratios, and theme alias coverage, including emo treatments.
- **Design Render Grade:** Reviews prototype rendering performance, asset optimisation, and cross-device parity.
- **Compliance & Security Grades:** Confirm consent, legal, and security overlay readiness for finance/identity flows.
- **Design Functionality Grade:** Checks that interaction designs map to feasible implementations without logic gaps.
- **Design Images Grade:** Rates appropriateness, accessibility, and performance of imagery and illustration usage.
- **Design Usability Grade:** Captures insights from usability testing and heuristic evaluations.
- **Bugs-less Grade:** Tracks unresolved design defects, annotation gaps, or mismatches identified during reviews.
- **Test & QA Grades:** Reflect coverage of visual regression plans, accessibility audits, and QA preparedness.
- **Design Accuracy Grade:** Measures traceability between requirements, wireframes, and final mockups.
- **Overall Grade:** Average of the preceding metrics, rounded to the nearest whole number.
- **Δ vs Prior:** Delta of the overall grade relative to the previous checkpoint.

## Critical Observations
1. **Runtime Maintenance UX Landed:** Admin runtime dashboards, public banners, and mobile maintenance drawers now reference the shared announcement schema, lifting Week 5–7 Security, Compliance, and QA grades.
2. **Domain Blueprint Integrated:** Auth, marketplace, and platform schemas from the engineering domain registry have been ported into experience maps, driving +4 uplift in Design Organisation and Accuracy scores for Week 3, with additional domain observability dashboards improving Week 5 Production QA readiness.
3. **Security Messaging Advancing:** Maintenance/downtime specs plus the runtime telemetry operations copy elevated the Security Grade to 80; final legal approval on payout escalations and RBAC copy is still pending alongside icon updates for WAF event states.
4. **Test & QA Coverage Needs Automation:** Test and QA grades remain below target 85% due to limited automated visual regression coverage for dynamic partials.
5. **Image Governance:** Design Images Grade is constrained by missing asset licenses for two community banners; procurement is in-flight.
6. **Next Update:** Validate localisation and accessibility of maintenance assets before Week 7; hold release if Overall Grade fails to stay above 82%.
7. **Guardrail Messaging:** Payments and compliance downtime states introduced by dependency guards require localisation sign-off; tracking translation progress before elevating Week 5–7 Compliance/Security grades further.

## Action Items
1. Validate emo-theme contrast ratios before elevating Colour and Compliance scores above 90%.
2. Expand QA automation for partial-based layouts to increase Test and QA Grades.
3. Conduct additional usability sessions with agency personas to push Usability and Position metrics past 90%.
4. Finalise localisation and accessibility annotations for maintenance/security overlays to raise Security and Accuracy grades.
5. Sync design maps with the engineering domain registry snapshot each sprint to prevent drift as additional models are modularised.
6. Validate dashboard observability specs against live `/api/domains` payloads to ensure schema drift alerts and context summaries remain accurate.
