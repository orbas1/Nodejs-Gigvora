# Version 1.50 Design Update Progress Tracker

Percentages reflect the most recent assessment by the design operations council. Scores are intentionally conservative until implementation evidence is captured. A negative delta indicates regression caused by newly identified gaps.

## Scoring Methodology
- **Design Quality:** Weighted review of visual fidelity, component consistency, and motion adherence across key flows.
- **Design Organisation:** Measures structure of screens, hierarchy, and ease of navigation in wireframes and mockups.
- **Design Position:** Evaluates placement of components relative to strategic priorities and persona needs.
- **Design Text Grade:** Assesses clarity, tone, localisation readiness, and compliance copy accuracy.
- **Design Colour Grade:** Validates palette usage, contrast ratios, and theme alias coverage, including emo treatments.
- **Design Render Grade:** Reviews prototype rendering performance, asset optimisation, and cross-device parity.
- **Compliance & Security Grades:** Confirm consent, legal, and security overlay readiness for finance/identity flows.
- **Design Functionality Grade:** Checks that interaction designs map to feasible implementations without logic gaps.
- **Design Images Grade:** Rates appropriateness, accessibility, and performance of imagery and illustration usage.
- **Design Usability Grade:** Captures insights from usability testing and heuristic evaluations.
- **Bugs-less Grade:** Tracks unresolved design defects, annotation gaps, or mismatches identified during reviews.
- **Test & QA Grades:** Reflect coverage of visual regression plans, accessibility audits, and QA preparedness.
- **Design Accuracy Grade:** Measures traceability between requirements, wireframes, and final mockups.
- **Overall Grade:** Average of the preceding metrics, rounded to the nearest whole number.
- **Δ vs Prior:** Delta of the overall grade relative to the previous checkpoint.

## Critical Observations
1. **Theme Readiness Still Fragile:** Launch readiness dipped because emo-theme contrast fixes introduced spacing regressions on marketing cards. Colour and organisation scores remain capped until remediation.
2. **Security Sign-off Lagging:** Security and compliance trails the rest due to pending legal approval of the reworded identity verification screen and missing tooltips on payout escalations.
3. **Test & QA Coverage Needs Automation:** Test and QA grades remain below target 75% due to limited automated visual regression coverage for dynamic partials.
4. **Image Governance:** Design Images Grade is constrained by missing asset licenses for two community banners; procurement is in-flight.
5. **Next Update:** Reassess metrics after Week 7 remediation sprint; hold release if Overall Grade fails to rebound above 80%.

## Action Items
1. Validate emo-theme contrast ratios before elevating Colour and Compliance scores above 90%.
2. Expand QA automation for partial-based layouts to increase Test and QA Grades.
3. Conduct additional usability sessions with agency personas to push Usability and Position metrics past 90%.
4. Close outstanding annotation gaps for security overlays to raise Security and Accuracy grades.
5. Monitor implementation feedback and update tracker weekly through release.
