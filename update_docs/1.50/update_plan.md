# Version 1.50 Update Plan

## Overview
This plan consolidates the Version 1.50 feature mandate with the critical defects and architectural gaps surfaced in the pre-update evaluations. Each task ties directly to the requirement matrices in the feature brief, the feature execution roadmap, and the identified issues/fix suggestions so that delivery teams can execute sequentially while preserving enterprise-grade quality.

## Dependencies & Sequencing
- Tasks 1–3 unblock downstream work by delivering secure foundations, schema stability, and governance guardrails.
- Tasks 4–7 can proceed once foundations are in place, with integration points flagged via shared schemas and feature flags.
- Task 8 overlaps with Tasks 4–7 but depends on API stability and shared contracts.
- Tasks 9–10 run continuously, with final sign-off contingent on successful completion of Tasks 1–8.

## Risk & Mitigation Summary
- **Scope Overload:** Prioritise features mapped to contractual requirements; defer optional enhancements via feature flags.
- **Integration Complexity:** Use sandbox environments, replayable webhooks, and contract testing to avoid production regressions.
- **Compliance Deadlines:** Engage security/legal review during Task 3 to avoid late-stage rework.
- **Resource Coordination:** Align cross-functional leads (security, payments, mobile, documentation) in weekly steering meetings per feature execution plan.
