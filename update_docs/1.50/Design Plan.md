# Version 1.50 Design Plan

## 1. Purpose & Guiding Principles
The Version 1.50 design effort establishes a unified multi-platform experience that mirrors business capabilities introduced in this release. The plan translates the "Application Design Update" and "Web Application Design Update" deliverables into an actionable roadmap for engineering, QA, and compliance stakeholders. Key principles:
- **Consistency:** Harmonise tokens, components, and content patterns across mobile (Flutter) and web clients.
- **Clarity:** Elevate discoverability of projects, messaging, and financial workflows with purposeful hierarchy and progressive disclosure.
- **Compliance & Trust:** Embed FCA-ready cues, security affordances, and audit trails directly into interface scaffolding.
- **Scalability:** Adopt modular templates that support future vertical expansions and localisation without rework.

## 2. Scope Overview
| Channel | Scope Elements | Primary Artifacts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Flutter Applications | Dashboard, projects, messaging, financial/escrow, onboarding, notifications, settings. | `Screens_Update.md`, `Screen_blueprints.md`, `Logic_Flow_map.md`, `Screens_update_images_and_vectors.md` |
| Web Application | Navigation, live feed, marketplace, compliance centre, provider tooling, chat, analytics. | `web_app_wireframe_changes.md`, `web_application_logic_flow_changes.md`, `web_application_styling_changes.md` |
| Shared Assets | Design tokens, typography, iconography, accessibility, QA sign-off templates. | `Colours.md`, `Fonts.md`, `Organisation_and_positions.md`, `Screens_Updates_widget_functions.md` |

## 3. Strategic Design Outcomes
1. **Unified Navigation Backbone:** Shared mental model and iconography across user/provider roles reducing onboarding time by ≥20%.
2. **Actionable Dashboards:** KPI-forward cards and inline actions, enabling quick project and financial decisions without deep navigation.
3. **Trust-Rich Transactions:** Escrow, dispute, and compliance screens present risk cues, audit trails, and support options proactively.
4. **Conversational Engagement:** Chat, notifications, and live feed consolidated into a consistent interaction pattern with moderation and offline support.
5. **Accessibility & Inclusivity:** WCAG 2.1 AA targets embedded into colors, typography, focus management, and motion guidelines.

## 4. Design Delivery Plan
### 4.1 Research & Foundations (Week 1)
- Validate personas, use cases, and regulatory requirements with product and compliance leads.
- Audit existing UI debt and accessibility gaps to prioritise remediation.
- Finalise design tokens (color, elevation, spacing, typography) and publish to shared library.

### 4.2 Structural Alignment (Weeks 2-3)
- Update mobile and web navigation maps, ensuring parity in IA and access paths for core flows.
- Produce responsive grid specifications, breakpoints, and layout templates for dashboards and transactional screens.
- Establish widget inventories with new states (idle, loading, error, disabled) for reuse.

### 4.3 Detailed Interface Authoring (Weeks 3-6)
- Craft annotated screen blueprints per module, including data bindings, validation rules, and localisation notes.
- Design chat, feed, and notification modules with moderation overlays and offline/failed state handling.
- Define financial workflow diagrams with trust indicators, dispute escalation points, and compliance copy.

### 4.4 Prototyping & Testing (Weeks 6-8)
- Build interactive prototypes covering cross-platform journeys (e.g., posting project → hiring → escrow release).
- Run moderated usability sessions with user and provider personas to validate clarity and task completion.
- Execute accessibility testing (screen readers, keyboard navigation, color contrast) and iterate on findings.

### 4.5 Implementation Support & Governance (Weeks 8-10)
- Deliver redlines, component specs, and Zeplin/Figma exports linked to Jira epics.
- Pair with engineering for design QA sign-off, tracking deviations and mitigation steps.
- Establish design regression checklist and embed into CI visual testing workflow.

### 4.6 Data Model Alignment & Instrumentation (Weeks 3-8)
- Map the newly introduced applications, messaging, notification, analytics, and provider workspace tables to concrete UI states documented in the screen and logic update packs.
- Provide event taxonomy overlays so every screen interaction (e.g., application review decision, message escalation, provider note creation) is tied to analytics identifiers captured in `analytics_events` and `analytics_daily_rollups`.
- Coordinate with backend and data squads on migration rehearsal checkpoints to guarantee design artefacts remain consistent with production schemas and auditing expectations.
- Partner with engineering on a production-grade seed dataset covering application stages, messaging threads, notification cadences, analytics rollups, and provider workspace membership so prototypes and QA reviews exercise realistic states.
- Document sanitized response schemas for the new Sequelize service layer (applications, messaging, notifications, analytics, provider workspaces) so UI copy, IA, and accessibility guidance reflect only publicly exposed fields and caching behaviour.
- Publish backend schema overview, ER diagram, and data governance addendum with matching automated tests to ground design QA, compliance reviews, and narrative updates in authoritative artefacts.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/docs/schema-overview.md†L3-L52】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/docs/er-diagram.md†L1-L33】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/docs/data-governance.md†L3-L25】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/tests/applicationService.test.js†L1-L84】

## 5. Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Incomplete parity between mobile and web modules | Medium | High | Weekly parity reviews, shared design token source of truth, cross-platform QA scripts. |
| Compliance copy or flows out-of-date with FCA guidance | Medium | High | Align with compliance lead each sprint, maintain legal review queue, document traceability in change log. |
| Engineering constraints causing design scope cuts | Medium | Medium | Prioritise core journeys, maintain alternate layouts, provide phased release options. |
| Accessibility regressions post-implementation | Medium | High | Automated contrast checks, manual screen-reader passes, add acceptance criteria per story. |
| Asset delivery delays (illustrations, icons) | Low | Medium | Pre-bake vector kits, define deadlines in task tracker, provide fallback assets. |

## 6. Approval Workflow
1. **Design Review:** Cross-functional review every Friday with design, product, engineering, QA, and compliance sign-off.
2. **Design QA:** Implemented screens validated against component specs with annotated feedback loops in Jira.
3. **Release Readiness:** Design sign-off required before milestone exit; unresolved issues logged in risk register and release notes.

## 7. Reporting & Hand-off
- Maintain `Design_Change_log.md` as canonical record of adjustments and stakeholder approvals.
- Update `design_update_progress_tracker.md` weekly; feed aggregated metrics into `update_progress_tracker.md`.
- Attach annotated exports and measurement artefacts to release documentation for audit readiness.
