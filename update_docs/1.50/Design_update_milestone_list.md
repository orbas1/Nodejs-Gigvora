# Version 1.50 Design Update Milestones

## Milestone 1 – Token & Theme Architecture Finalisation (Week 1–2)
**Objective:** Ship unified design tokens, emo theme variations, and accessibility-compliant palettes across app and web.
- Publish colour/typography/spacing/elevation tokens to shared libraries and engineering packages.
- Validate high-contrast and emo themes with automated contrast testing and manual review.
- Document theme switching guidelines, fallback behaviors, and partial compatibility in design system docs.

## Milestone 2 – Application Experience Blueprinting (Week 2–4)
**Objective:** Reorganise authenticated application screens per persona, updating widgets, logic flows, and copy.
- Finalise screen inventories (`Screens_list.md`) and priority zones per persona.
- Deliver annotated wireframes for dashboards, studios, finance flows, and settings.
- Align widget functions, states, and API expectations through `Screens_Updates_widget_functions.md` updates.
- **Status 05 Apr:** Architecture domain map annotated with auth/marketplace/platform ownership, and feature flag management wireframes drafted for dashboard integration; ERD visual refresh pending stakeholder review.
- **Status 06 Apr:** Added domain registry observability panels to dashboard specs, linking `/api/domains` metadata to design annotations and TypeScript contract references.
- **Status 07 Apr:** Runtime telemetry panel designs now capture `/api/admin/runtime/health` outputs with dependency badges, rate-limit trend bars, and localisation-ready incident copy. Accessibility notes cover screen-reader announcements and focus management for manual refresh interactions.
- **Status 10 Apr:** Admin maintenance registry and cross-platform downtime banners specced, including lifecycle toasts, dismissal controls, and mobile drawer guidance tied to the new runtime maintenance APIs. QA checklist updated with aria-live and localisation scenarios.
- **Status 13 Apr:** Admin runtime dashboards now include database pool gauges and shutdown confirmation overlays aligned with the new lifecycle service; accessibility annotations capture ARIA labels for connection metrics and audit toasts.

## Milestone 3 – Web Marketing & Dashboard Refresh (Week 3–5)
**Objective:** Modernise marketing site, landing hero, and authenticated dashboards with modular partials.
- Redesign home page hero, testimonials, pricing, and CTA placements using new component tokens.
- Expand supporting pages (Community, Compliance, Careers) using partial catalog.
- Update web dashboards (marketing + authenticated) to match refreshed component styling and data density guidelines.

## Milestone 4 – Theme & Partial Infrastructure Enablement (Week 4–6)
**Objective:** Implement runtime theme toggles, emo kits, and partial-driven page assembly.
- Configure CMS slots and template wrappers for theme injection.
- Produce emo-theme asset packs (imagery, copy tone, icon overlays) with compliance validation.
- Deliver QA checklist covering theme permutations across responsive breakpoints.

## Milestone 5 – Governance, Accessibility, and Security Enhancements (Week 5–6)
**Objective:** Ensure design outputs respect compliance, accessibility, and security guidelines across surfaces.
- Audit consent, legal, and security flows to confirm overlays, banners, and copy updates.
- Run accessibility sweeps (WCAG AA) on redesigned screens, documenting remediation steps.
- Provide security-sensitive UI patterns for finance, identity verification, and audit trails.
- **Status 04 Apr:** Maintenance-mode messaging, health telemetry widgets, and rate-limit callouts are specced with localisation guidance; pending review includes integrating the assets into emo theme variations and validating screen-reader announcements.
- **Status 07 Apr:** Operations playbook overlays incorporate runtime telemetry alerts, and compliance approved the admin dashboard copy deck; remaining scope focuses on emo theme permutations and security sign-off for provider maintenance workflows.
- **Status 10 Apr:** Maintenance announcement localisation packs, accessibility annotations, and incident analytics hooks delivered to engineering; pending actions limited to regulator artefact bundling.
- **Status 11 Apr:** Payments and compliance guard downtime states specced for finance dashboards and compliance locker workflows, including request ID surfacing and legal escalation copy; awaiting localisation sign-off for translated guard messaging.

## Milestone 6 – Handoff, QA, and Implementation Support (Week 6–7)
**Objective:** Equip engineering and QA teams with detailed documentation, assets, and review rituals.
- Compile developer handoff packages (redlines, token JSON, component usage, logic diagrams).
- Facilitate design QA walkthroughs and backlog triage with engineering squads.
- Monitor implementation progress, capture change requests, and prepare launch communications.
