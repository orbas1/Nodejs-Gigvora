# Version 1.50 Design Progress Tracker
All metrics are scored out of 100% based on latest reviews across the "Application Design Update" and "Web Application Design Update" workstreams. Scores reflect actual artefact quality, readiness for engineering, and evidence captured in reviews. Overall Grade is the mean of the preceding metrics.

| Metric | Status (%) | Evidence & Notes |

| Design Organisation | 60 | Documented ownership matrix links backend tables, governance roles, and automated tests, while the Flutter data layer mirrors those contracts with shared repository/controller patterns for discovery surfaces.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/docs/schema-overview.md†L43-L52】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/marketplace/application/opportunity_controller.dart†L1-L156】|
| Design Position | 54 | Access control, retention, and visibility rules define persona-specific entry points for dashboards, audit drawers, and provider notes.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/docs/data-governance.md†L5-L16】|
| Design Text Grade | 58 | Governance policy outlines sanitised payload messaging, attachment copy, and retention disclosures required in refreshed content guidelines.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/docs/data-governance.md†L18-L21】|
| Design Colour Grade | 55 | Tokenised palette reviewed with accessibility contrast checks; dark mode variants remain pending milestone 2 sign-off.【F:update_docs/1.50/ui-ux_updates/Application Design Update/Screen_update_Screen_colours.md†L12-L40】|
| Design Render Grade | 52 | ER diagram plus schema overview inform storyboard overlays and redlines ensuring interactions reflect real relationships and audit cues.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/docs/er-diagram.md†L1-L33】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/docs/schema-overview.md†L3-L41】|
| Compliance Grade | 58 | Retention windows, audit metadata, and governance responsibilities provide concrete requirements for compliance-first surfaces and documentation.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/docs/data-governance.md†L10-L21】|
| Security Grade | 66 | Cache eviction, audit trails, and role-based checks recorded in the governance pack anchor security affordances and review gates.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/docs/data-governance.md†L5-L9】|
| Design Functionality Grade | 70 | Service contracts, retention policies, and automated tests now drive live Flutter implementations with cache-aware refresh indicators, analytics hooks, and category filters across feed, marketplace, and explorer flows.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/docs/schema-overview.md†L5-L41】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/explorer/presentation/explorer_screen.dart†L1-L278】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/feed/application/feed_controller.dart†L1-L117】|
| Design Images Grade | 50 | ER diagram supports asset planning by clarifying which relationships require iconography and vector updates while remaining illustrations progress in backlog.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/docs/er-diagram.md†L1-L33】|
| Design Usability Grade | 60 | Seed states and governance expectations now translate into Flutter offline banners, loading skeletons, and empty-state copy that guide usability testing for poor-connectivity journeys.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/docs/data-governance.md†L23-L25】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/feed/presentation/feed_screen.dart†L1-L213】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/marketplace/presentation/opportunity_list.dart†L1-L189】|
| Bugs-less Grade | 64 | Change log now references schema, governance, and automated suites ensuring traceability between UX states, QA evidence, and backend contracts.【F:update_docs/1.50/Design_Change_log.md†L6-L92】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/docs/data-governance.md†L5-L25】|
| Test Grade | 55 | Jest integration suites validate applications, messaging, notifications, and provider workflows using SQLite, providing reusable evidence for design QA sign-off.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/tests/applicationService.test.js†L1-L84】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/tests/messagingService.test.js†L1-L69】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/tests/notificationService.test.js†L1-L58】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/tests/providerWorkspaceService.test.js†L1-L66】|
| QA Grade | 58 | Governance pack, schema docs, and automated suites establish explicit QA acceptance criteria and monitoring expectations for milestone exit.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/docs/data-governance.md†L23-L33】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/tests/applicationService.test.js†L1-L84】|
| Design Accuracy Grade | 60 | Unified schema, governance, and ER artefacts keep design specifications aligned to production models, reducing mismatch risk during implementation reviews.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/docs/schema-overview.md†L3-L52】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/docs/er-diagram.md†L1-L33】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/docs/data-governance.md†L3-L25】|
| Overall Grade | 61 | Documentation, automated validation, and implemented Flutter discovery/feed experiences raise readiness across compliance, QA, and engineering collaboration while outstanding visuals progress in subsequent milestones.|

## Measurement Methodology
- **Review Cadence:** Weekly cross-functional design reviews produce updated scores documented in `Design_Change_log.md`.
- **Evidence Sources:** Figma audit trails, accessibility reports, compliance feedback, and QA sign-off sheets.
- **Update Process:** Metrics revised upon completion of milestone deliverables or validation activities; changes logged with rationale and reviewer signature.
