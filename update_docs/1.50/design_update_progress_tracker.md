# Version 1.50 Design Progress Tracker
All metrics are scored out of 100% based on latest reviews across the "Application Design Update" and "Web Application Design Update" workstreams. Scores reflect actual artefact quality, readiness for engineering, and evidence captured in reviews. Overall Grade is the mean of the preceding metrics.

| Metric | Status (%) | Evidence & Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Design Quality | 38 | Foundational tokens approved but major screens pending redesign; legacy artefacts still in circulation.
| Design Organisation | 42 | Directory structure mapped and tagged, however component inventories require consolidation and clear ownership.
| Design Position | 35 | Layout blueprints drafted for dashboards only; other modules awaiting final positioning approval.
| Design Text Grade | 40 | Typography scale defined but content guidelines not yet localised or validated through QA.
| Design Colour Grade | 55 | Tokenised palette reviewed with accessibility contrast checks; dark mode variants incomplete.
| Design Render Grade | 30 | Limited high-fidelity renders produced; most modules remain at wireframe fidelity.
| Compliance Grade | 33 | Compliance overlays identified but awaiting legal review and documentation sign-off.
| Security Grade | 28 | Security messaging patterns drafted; encryption/MFA flows not yet incorporated in all screens.
| Design Functionality Grade | 36 | Interaction specs exist for chat/feed, but financial workflows lack detailed state coverage.
| Design Images Grade | 48 | Vector replacements underway with 60% of screens upgraded; remaining assets in backlog.
| Design Usability Grade | 32 | No moderated studies completed; assumptions based on heuristic reviews only.
| Bugs-less Grade | 45 | Known inconsistencies logged, but validation in staging not started; regression checklist incomplete.
| Test Grade | 25 | Automated visual regression suite not yet configured; manual testing plan drafted but unexecuted.
| QA Grade | 30 | QA review cadence defined, yet zero sign-offs recorded pending first build review.
| Design Accuracy Grade | 34 | Alignment between documentation and prototypes inconsistent; engineering feedback still pending.
| Overall Grade | 36 | Average across metrics; indicates significant work required before release readiness.

## Measurement Methodology
- **Review Cadence:** Weekly cross-functional design reviews produce updated scores documented in `Design_Change_log.md`.
- **Evidence Sources:** Figma audit trails, accessibility reports, compliance feedback, and QA sign-off sheets.
- **Update Process:** Metrics revised upon completion of milestone deliverables or validation activities; changes logged with rationale and reviewer signature.
