# Version 1.50 Design Progress Tracker
All metrics are scored out of 100% based on latest reviews across the "Application Design Update" and "Web Application Design Update" workstreams. Scores reflect actual artefact quality, readiness for engineering, and evidence captured in reviews. Overall Grade is the mean of the preceding metrics.

| Compliance Grade | 48 | Provider logic flows address audit exports, invite lifecycle, compliance notes, and service-driven visibility constraints tied to backend migrations, improving regulatory coverage.【F:update_docs/1.50/ui-ux_updates/provider_application_logic_flow_changes.md†L7-L32】【F:update_docs/1.50/ui-ux_updates/Application Design Update/Logic_Flow_update.md†L8-L24】|
| Security Grade | 64 | Persona flows and provider governance document stage audits, notification overrides, workspace controls, and sanitized data exposure rules aligning with new security requirements.【F:update_docs/1.50/ui-ux_updates/Application Design Update/Logic_Flow_update.md†L8-L24】|
| Design Functionality Grade | 58 | Web logic blueprint outlines application pipeline behaviours, review drawers, bulk actions, notification guardrails, and cache-aware refresh triggers grounded in the new persistence model and ORM services.【F:update_docs/1.50/ui-ux_updates/web_application_logic_flow_changes.md†L13-L35】|
| Design Images Grade | 48 | Vector replacements underway with 60% of screens upgraded; remaining assets in backlog.|
| Design Usability Grade | 45 | Roadmap now schedules usability validation for application review boards and provider workspaces alongside refresh cues for cached data scenarios.【F:update_docs/1.50/ui-ux_updates/Application Design Update/Screens_Update_Plan.md†L13-L26】【F:update_docs/1.50/ui-ux_updates/Application Design Update/Screens_Update.md†L142-L208】|
| Bugs-less Grade | 57 | Central changelog tracks application workflow states, notification governance, provider compliance diagrams, and service contract notes for QA traceability.【F:update_docs/1.50/Design_Change_log.md†L6-L78】|
| Test Grade | 40 | Design change log and governance plans enumerate analytics instrumentation, cache invalidation triggers, and audit export touchpoints requiring automated validation.【F:update_docs/1.50/ui-ux_updates/design_change_log.md†L35-L70】|
| QA Grade | 44 | Data-driven workflow expansion captured with compliance-ready specs and service contract annotations, setting clear QA expectations for upcoming implementation reviews.【F:update_docs/1.50/ui-ux_updates/design_change_log.md†L35-L70】|
| Design Accuracy Grade | 50 | Migration-aligned design artefacts mirror backend schemas, sanitised service payloads, and instrumentation commitments documented in the change log and design plan, including curated seed scenarios for review parity.【F:update_docs/1.50/Design Plan.md†L47-L71】【F:update_docs/1.50/Design Plan.md†L86-L96】【F:update_docs/1.50/Design_Change_log.md†L6-L78】|
| Overall Grade | 52 | Score uplift reflects broadened coverage of schema-driven experiences, cache-aware interactions, and sanitised payload guidance while remaining modules continue in progress.|

## Measurement Methodology
- **Review Cadence:** Weekly cross-functional design reviews produce updated scores documented in `Design_Change_log.md`.
- **Evidence Sources:** Figma audit trails, accessibility reports, compliance feedback, and QA sign-off sheets.
- **Update Process:** Metrics revised upon completion of milestone deliverables or validation activities; changes logged with rationale and reviewer signature.
