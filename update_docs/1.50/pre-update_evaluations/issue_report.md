# Issue Report – Version 1.50 Pre-Update Evaluations

## Backend Platform
The API server still resembles an MVP prototype instead of an enterprise service. `src/server.js` bootstraps long-running workers during startup without readiness probes, isolation, or graceful shutdown hooks; a single rejected promise prevents the Express listener from ever binding to its port. Controllers wired through `src/routes/index.js` accept arbitrary JSON and bypass schema validation, so malformed filters, oversized payloads, or missing fields bubble into Sequelize exceptions or silent failures. Massive model definitions in `src/models/index.js` intermix hundreds of enums, duplicated messaging models, and business logic without modular boundaries, making it impossible for feature teams to evolve the domain safely. Mega-controllers blend persistence, notifications, and search mutations while routing exposes partially built modules like workspace templates that crash as soon as they are called. Even the global error handler is misdeclared in `src/middleware/errorHandler.js`, so Express skips centralized error serialization entirely. Core workflows for payments, escrow, and compliance remain placeholders that neither enforce state transitions nor reconcile with third-party providers. Operational tooling is absent—no structured logging, health/readiness probes beyond `/health`, nor worker observability—and security posture is weak thanks to permissive CORS defaults, plaintext OTP tokens, over-shared session metadata, and the lack of rate limiting or audit trails. The backend falls well short of the resilience, compliance, and governance promised to stakeholders.

## Dependency & Tooling Landscape
The repository’s dependency strategy lacks the automation needed for coordinated releases across backend, web, and mobile clients. Shared enums and DTOs are duplicated manually across `src/models/constants/index.js`, React constants, and Flutter foundation packages, ensuring drift the moment a status changes. Critical SDKs for advertised capabilities (Stripe payouts, Cloudflare R2 storage, Agora calls, Mapbox visualization) are either missing or only partially installed, so enabling those features today results in build failures or stubbed responses. Toolchain guidance is nonexistent—no `.nvmrc`, `.tool-versions`, or lockfile discipline—and large directories such as `node_modules/` are checked into source control, inflating clone times and obscuring supply-chain tampering. JavaScript packages ignore workspace tooling while Flutter relies on local path dependencies, so automation such as `melos.yaml` or `codemagic.yaml` never materialises. Security and quality safeguards (Dependabot, vulnerability scans, formatting/lint presets, TypeScript enforcement, Melos/Turborepo orchestration) are absent, and secrets leak across `.env.example` and documentation. Claims about a robust partner ecosystem are unsubstantiated without published SDKs, reproducible Docker images, or signed binaries.

## Data Layer & Database Operations
The persistence layer cannot support the breadth of domain logic expressed in code. Sequelize migrations such as `20240501001000-create-marketplace-tables.cjs` create minimal tables that ignore the hundreds of columns and enums defined in `src/models/index.js`, leaving production schemas incapable of satisfying model expectations. Indexing, referential integrity, and audit requirements go unmet: core tables omit foreign keys, composite indexes for search filters, tenant identifiers, and soft-delete columns. Materialised views, warehouse feeds, and lookup tables referenced by analytics controllers do not exist. Tests rely on `sequelize.sync({ force: true })` against SQLite, masking MySQL-specific constraints and preventing detection of migration drift. Configuration files disagree on connection settings, and connection pools run with defaults that will starve the database under load. There is no ERD, seeding strategy, or backup plan, and sensitive fields remain plaintext without retention or deletion policies, so exports leak PII the moment they run. These gaps make regulatory compliance, analytics, and disaster recovery untenable.

## Web Front-end
The React application advertises enterprise depth but delivers little functional value. `src/App.jsx` defines conflicting public and protected routes, duplicating key paths and inadvertently bypassing guards while inflating render overhead with redundant provider wrappers. Dashboards and workflows render mock data through `useCachedResource` instead of real API calls, and there is no React Query/SWR layer, error boundaries, or centralized retry logic. Session handling depends on `localStorage`, lacking refresh tokens or revocation, so users drop out silently. Massive landing pages like `HomePage.jsx` hard-code marketing copy and imagery, meaning growth experiments require code deploys and load every asset regardless of segment. Accessibility, localization, and responsive design are unimplemented despite existing scaffolding, and bundle splitting is ignored even for niche dashboards. Build tooling has not been hardened for heavy integrations (Mapbox, Agora), no automated testing exists, feature flags are local mocks, and secrets such as API keys ship in the bundle. Telemetry hooks would leak PII the moment analytics SDKs are enabled. Overall, the web client cannot satisfy promised analytics, collaboration, or compliance experiences.

## Flutter User Application
The mobile app mirrors web navigation but remains a demonstration build. `lib/main.dart` hard-codes an administrator JWT and configures the service locator twice, so genuine authentication, token refresh, or secure storage do not exist. Screens under `features/*` depend on mocked repositories and Riverpod providers that return placeholder futures; uploads, messaging, and analytics are non-functional, and modules blend domain logic with presentation in single files. `lib/router/app_router.dart` registers dozens of routes with duplicated imports and fragile inline guards, yet most destinations render static layouts and ignore deep-link parameters. There is no testing, logging, crash reporting, or release automation, build flavours are undefined, and secrets live in source control without secure storage. Push tokens are logged in plaintext, network security (SSL pinning, environment selection) is absent, and tablet/desktop personas receive unoptimised layouts. The app is incompatible with enterprise mobility requirements touted in sales collateral.
