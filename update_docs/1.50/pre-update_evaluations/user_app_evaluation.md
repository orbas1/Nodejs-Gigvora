# User App Evaluation – Version 1.50 Pre-Update

## Functionality
- Authentication screens only toggle local state and snackbars; there is no API call, token handling, or persistence of 2FA state beyond the widget lifecycle.【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/auth/presentation/login_screen.dart†L1-L72】
- Registration, explorer, feed, and marketplace flows render static placeholder lists, so users cannot actually browse live opportunities or submit applications from the mobile app.【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/auth/presentation/register_screen.dart†L1-L44】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/explorer/presentation/explorer_screen.dart†L1-L76】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/feed/presentation/feed_screen.dart†L1-L56】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/marketplace/presentation/jobs_screen.dart†L1-L48】
- Navigation defaults to `/feed` without onboarding or role-based routing, ignoring differences between freelancers, agencies, and admins that the product narrative emphasizes.【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/router/app_router.dart†L1-L34】

## Usability
- Forms lack basic ergonomics (no input masking, keyboard submit actions, or scroll-to-error feedback), causing friction on smaller devices.【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/auth/presentation/register_screen.dart†L9-L37】
- Choice-heavy screens like Explorer use `ChoiceChip` components without persistent filters or search history, so context resets whenever the widget rebuilds.【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/explorer/presentation/explorer_screen.dart†L1-L76】
- Visual system leans on a single `GigvoraScaffold`, but there is no dark-mode handling or typography scaling, reducing accessibility for different user preferences.【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/theme/widgets.dart†L1-L68】

## Errors
- Snackbars always report success, even though no backend call is made; once integrations exist, the UX will misrepresent failures and lacks retry cues.【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/auth/presentation/login_screen.dart†L37-L64】
- Text editing controllers in `LoginScreen` are never disposed, leading to memory leaks on repeated navigations or hot reloads.【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/auth/presentation/login_screen.dart†L9-L40】
- None of the list pages guard against empty datasets or API failures, so integrating a backend will likely crash or render blank screens without messaging.【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/feed/presentation/feed_screen.dart†L1-L56】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/marketplace/presentation/jobs_screen.dart†L1-L48】

## Integration
- There is no repository/service layer or Riverpod provider for data fetching despite including `http` and `flutter_riverpod`, preventing alignment with backend endpoints.【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/pubspec.yaml†L1-L21】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/router/app_router.dart†L1-L34】
- Deep linking and authenticated route guards are absent; GoRouter is used only for static paths, leaving push notifications or shared URLs unsupported.【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/router/app_router.dart†L1-L34】
- Theme/widgets layer does not expose platform channel hooks, so integrations like file uploads or payments promised in roadmap discussions cannot start from this baseline.【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/theme/widgets.dart†L1-L68】

## Security
- Sensitive inputs (email, password, 2FA code) live in plain `TextEditingController`s without secure text entry flags beyond `obscureText`, and there is no biometric or device binding support.【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/auth/presentation/login_screen.dart†L9-L64】
- Without secure storage libraries, any eventual token storage would default to insecure shared preferences, violating security expectations for a professional network.【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/pubspec.yaml†L1-L21】
- Admin login routes are bundled into the user app with no role gating, increasing attack surface if the APK is redistributed widely.【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/router/app_router.dart†L1-L34】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/admin/presentation/admin_login_screen.dart†L1-L80】

## Alignment
- Mobile copy mirrors the web promise of synced experiences, yet the lack of backend connectivity or offline caching means the app cannot uphold that parity.【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/feed/presentation/feed_screen.dart†L1-L56】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/pages/RegisterPage.jsx†L70-L88】
- No support exists for provider/agency modules despite strategic emphasis on multi-sided marketplaces; navigation only addresses end-user surfaces.【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/router/app_router.dart†L1-L34】
- Analytics, crash reporting, and experimentation SDKs are absent, so the mobile channel cannot contribute to data-driven decision making outlined in the update roadmap.【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/pubspec.yaml†L1-L21】
