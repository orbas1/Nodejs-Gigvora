# User App (Flutter) Evaluation – Version 1.50

## Functionality
- **Authentication is non-existent.** `lib/main.dart` injects a hard-coded JWT via `ServiceLocator.configure`, bypassing any login flow. Screens under `features/auth` present static forms with no controllers, API calls, or validation. Users cannot authenticate, refresh tokens, or recover accounts.
- **Feature screens are placeholders.** Dashboards, analytics, and messaging views render static mock data from `fixtures`. Repository classes under `core/data` return `Future.value` placeholders rather than calling APIs. The app cannot create gigs, respond to offers, or interact with collaboration features.
- **Background services are stubs.** Push notifications, analytics, and feature flags are wired through Riverpod providers, but implementations merely log to the console. No Firebase/OneSignal setup, analytics dispatch, or crash reporting integration exists.
- **File uploads and media handling are unimplemented.** Screens referencing document uploads or avatar changes display controls but never invoke pickers or storage clients. There is no integration with backend upload endpoints or secure storage.
- **Offline and synchronization scenarios are ignored.** Despite references to cached dashboards, there is no persistence layer (Hive, SQLite) or synchronization queue. Any network hiccup leaves the app in loading states without recovery.
- **Navigation graph is sprawling yet shallow.** `lib/router/app_router.dart` registers dozens of routes with duplicated imports and inline guards, but most destinations return static widgets. Deep links, query parameters, and nested navigation stacks remain unimplemented, so the router cannot support enterprise workflows.
- **Module boundaries blur responsibilities.** Feature packages under `lib/features/` mingle domain entities, view models, and UI widgets in single files. Without clear separation, reusing functionality across admin/agency personas requires copy-paste.
- **State initialisation is demo-focused.** Providers in `core/providers.dart` pre-populate caches with mock `Session` objects and design tokens from local packages. Production credentials or remote configs will be overridden unless the bootstrap flow is rewritten.

## Usability
- **Design system integration is fragile.** Theme configuration depends on local packages (`gigvora_design_system`) with limited documentation. Missing assets or mismatched versions fall back to default Material theming, causing inconsistent branding.
- **Navigation lacks polish.** Guarded routes redirect unauthenticated users to `/login`, yet the login route cannot proceed. Deep links and nested navigators are untested; bottom navigation does not highlight the active section consistently.
- **Forms lack validation and feedback.** Inputs accept any text, numbers, or file attachments without validation. Errors are not surfaced—failed submissions remain on screen with no messaging.
- **Accessibility is underdeveloped.** Widgets omit semantics, labels, and focus management. Screen readers cannot traverse complex layouts, and there is no support for dynamic text scaling or high-contrast themes.
- **Localization is incomplete.** Localization delegates exist, but strings across modules are hard-coded English. Locale switching does not persist between sessions or propagate to date/number formatting.
- **Motion and transitions are jarring.** Large hero carousels and dashboards fade in without animation curves or accessibility toggles. Reduced motion preferences are ignored, and repeated `AnimatedOpacity` widgets hurt performance.
- **Tablet/desktop adaptations are absent.** Despite enterprise positioning, layouts under `features/dashboard` assume mobile portrait widths. There is no adaptive grid, making the app unsuitable for iPad or desktop form factors.

## Errors & Stability
- **Initialization is error-prone.** `main.dart` calls `ServiceLocator.configure` twice, registering duplicate interceptors and providers. When real HTTP clients are introduced this will duplicate headers and cause authentication failures.
- **Async errors are swallowed.** Providers catch exceptions and call `debugPrint` without notifying the UI. Users see perpetual loading spinners with no retry states, unacceptable for production reliability.
- **Testing strategy is absent.** There are no unit tests, widget tests, or integration tests. The default template in `integration_test/` is untouched, providing zero assurance over mission-critical flows.
- **State management is loosely controlled.** Riverpod providers return dynamic maps without type safety or schema validation. A malformed API response could crash multiple screens due to unchecked assumptions.
- **Performance instrumentation is missing.** There is no profiling, logging, or crash analytics. Diagnosing freezes, jank, or exceptions in the field would be impossible.
- **Router guards are brittle.** Inline guards in `app_router.dart` repeatedly fetch `session.memberships`, assuming the collection is non-null. Null sessions throw, and there is no central guard framework to avoid duplication.
- **Resource cleanup is overlooked.** Streams and controllers instantiated in feature modules (e.g., chat, notifications) are never disposed, leaking memory across long sessions.
- **Build flavours are untested.** `flutter run --flavor` paths referenced in documentation lack configuration in `pubspec.yaml` or Android/iOS manifests. Attempting to produce staging builds fails.

## Integration
- **API communication is insecure and inflexible.** The app uses a static bearer token and lacks environment-specific endpoints, SSL pinning, or secure storage. There is no refresh token handling or secure persistence via Keychain/Keystore.
- **Third-party services are unconfigured.** References to Firebase, analytics, and feature flag services exist, but there are no dependency configurations, environment files, or initialization flows. Teams cannot validate integrations without major rework.
- **Local packages impede distribution.** Path-based dependencies make it difficult to publish the app or reuse libraries across teams. Without Melos or versioned packages, collaboration with partner apps is brittle.
- **Build and release automation is nonexistent.** No Fastlane scripts, CI workflows, or code signing documentation exist. Delivering builds to QA or app stores requires manual, error-prone steps.
- **Device capabilities are unused.** Camera, file picker, and location permissions are referenced but never requested. Integrating identity verification or geolocation workflows is impossible.
- **Platform channel strategy is absent.** There are no native platform integrations (background services, push bridges, biometrics). Enterprise requirements for device management and secure enclave usage cannot be met.
- **Deep-link promises are hollow.** Marketing copy advertises shareable workspace links, yet `app_router.dart` ignores query parameters and fragments. External invitations cannot open specific tabs or modals.
- **Analytics contracts diverge.** Event names defined in `core/telemetry` are never exported for partner SDKs, and payloads include entire session objects. Downstream warehouses will reject oversized events.

## Security
- **Secrets are exposed.** The hard-coded JWT in source control is a severe security issue. If it corresponds to a real account, any developer or attacker can impersonate an administrator.
- **Sensitive data lacks secure storage.** There is no `flutter_secure_storage`, platform keychain usage, or encrypted database. Future tokens or personal data stored in memory can be extracted on compromised devices.
- **Input sanitization is absent.** Rich text editors and chat inputs accept arbitrary HTML/Markdown without sanitization, risking injection once messages sync to other clients.
- **Transport security is weak.** There is no SSL pinning, certificate validation customization, or network security configuration. Man-in-the-middle attacks could intercept credentials or session data.
- **Compliance controls are missing.** There are no audit logs, consent flows, or privacy controls in the mobile experience. Users cannot manage notifications, data sharing, or account deletion from the app.
- **Device posture checks are unavailable.** The app does not detect jailbreak/root status or enforce minimum OS versions, undermining enterprise mobile management promises.
- **Push tokens are mishandled.** Placeholder implementations send device tokens over unsecured logging statements, risking interception. There is no revocation or rotation logic.

## Alignment
- **Enterprise mobility goals are unmet.** The app aspires to mirror the web dashboard, but without authentication, networking, or secure storage it remains a showcase rather than a deployable client.
- **Stakeholder expectations are misaligned.** Product roadmaps highlight on-the-go workforce management and secure collaboration, yet the current implementation provides none of those capabilities. Delivering on commitments requires foundational rebuilds.
- **Quality gates are non-existent.** Without testing, analytics, or release automation, the app cannot meet enterprise SLAs or compliance checkpoints. Foundational platform readiness must precede new feature work.
- **Mobile-specific requirements are ignored.** There is no offline strategy, push notification roadmap, or mobile accessibility plan, contradicting enterprise customer expectations.
- **Sales collateral overpromises parity.** Feature lists cite agency dashboards, ATS automation, and secure comms—all wired into `app_router.dart`—but each route renders placeholder scaffolds. Enterprise buyers would consider this deceptive once piloted.
