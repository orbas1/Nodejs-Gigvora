# Front-end Evaluation – Version 1.50

## Functionality
- **Routing and access control are contradictory.** `src/App.jsx` declares overlapping route trees—public, protected, and duplicated `/search`, `/projects`, `/mentors`, `/volunteering` entries. Because React Router uses the first matching path, downstream definitions bypass intended guards, loading privileged dashboards for unauthenticated visitors and bloating bundles with dead routes.
- **Data fetching is largely missing.** Service modules advertise dozens of REST calls, yet dashboards (`UserDashboardPage.jsx`, `CompanyDashboardPage.jsx`) render placeholder data through `useCachedResource` mocks. There is no React Query/SWR integration, so finance, analytics, and collaboration pages ship without live data.
- **Session management is brittle.** Authentication relies on `useSession` reading `localStorage` tokens from `src/services/apiClient.js`. There is no refresh token exchange, expiry handling, or background reauthentication, causing silent session drops on reload or network hiccups.
- **Core workflows are unfinished.** Project creation, gig posting, and messaging flows navigate to multi-step wizards that never persist state or call APIs. File uploads and rich text editors render UI controls with no backend integration, blocking business-critical journeys.
- **Performance-sensitive features lack optimization.** Map visualisations, Agora video, and large analytics lists render eagerly without virtualization or code-splitting. Initial page loads exceed enterprise thresholds and risk crashing low-memory devices.
- **Design system usage is inconsistent.** Shared typography, spacing, and button styles drift between bespoke components instead of `layouts/MainLayout.jsx` or a centralized design library, producing visual inconsistency and increasing maintenance overhead.
- **Large landing screens are static brochures.** `src/pages/HomePage.jsx` hard-codes hero cards, testimonials, and imagery directly in JSX. Without CMS integration or lazy loading, marketing updates require code deploys and the 7KB+ hero block loads on every visit, hindering personalization and experimentation.
- **Context providers lack isolation.** `src/App.jsx` mounts heavy providers (session, feature flags) at the root, but nested routes instantiate additional context wrappers (`MembershipGate`, `RoleProtectedRoute`) for the same data. The duplication inflates render cycles and complicates future SSR.

## Usability
- **Responsive design is incomplete.** Tailwind layouts fixate on desktop breakpoints (`px-24`, `grid-cols-4`). Tablet and mobile views overflow, clip charts, and hide navigation. No mobile-first testing or breakpoints exist for critical dashboards.
- **Accessibility standards are unmet.** Custom modals, dropdowns, and tabs omit ARIA roles, keyboard traps, and focus management. Screen readers cannot navigate dashboards, violating WCAG expectations.
- **Localization infrastructure is unused.** `src/i18n` scaffolding exists, yet UI strings remain hard-coded English. Language toggles do not persist or rehydrate across sessions, undermining global readiness.
- **Error feedback is limited.** API failures bubble to the console or leave empty states. There are no toast systems, inline validation, or retry affordances for network issues.
- **Navigation lacks clarity.** Dashboard deep links (`/dashboard/freelancer/pipeline`, `/dashboard/company/analytics`) expose nested layouts without breadcrumbs or active state indicators, confusing users.
- **Content density overwhelms users.** Mega-pages like `ProjectsPage.jsx` and `FeedPage.jsx` combine filters, kanban boards, and analytics in a single scroll container with no progressive disclosure. Enterprise personas cannot focus on primary tasks.
- **Documentation for power features is missing.** Advanced navigation components under `src/components/routing/` expose props like `requiredMemberships`, yet there is no handbook or inline guidance. Admins configuring access rules risk misusing guards and locking out users.

## Errors & Stability
- **Lack of error boundaries.** No React error boundaries protect route segments. A single exception crashes the entire application shell, delivering blank screens to customers.
- **Testing infrastructure is missing.** There is no Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress, Storybook, or visual regression tooling. Front-end regressions ship unchecked.
- **Build-time resilience is weak.** `vite.config.js` ships near defaults and lacks worker configuration for Mapbox, Agora WebRTC shims, or bundle analysis. Production builds risk failing as soon as optional SDKs initialize.
- **State management has no safeguards.** Context providers expose mutable objects without memoization or schema validation. Malformed data propagates across components, causing rendering loops or stale UI.
- **Analytics and logging are absent.** There is no client-side logging strategy, error reporting (Sentry), or performance monitoring, limiting visibility into runtime failures.
- **Legacy bundles linger.** Static assets under `images/` and unused components remain referenced even after UI rewrites, inflating bundle size and caching liabilities.
- **Form libraries are underutilised.** Multiple pages implement ad-hoc state with `useState` instead of using React Hook Form or Formik. Validation and submission flows diverge, increasing the chance of runtime errors.
- **Bundle splitting is ignored.** `src/main.jsx` mounts the entire route tree synchronously; there is no dynamic import for rarely used dashboards (e.g., `CompanyAtsOperationsPage.jsx`). Slow clients will stall before the first paint.

## Integration
- **Environment handling is fragile.** `src/services/apiClient.js` defaults to `http://localhost:4000/api`, conflicting with backend defaults (`5000`). Developers must align env files manually, and there is no per-environment configuration management.
- **Token handling is insecure and inconsistent.** Headers are derived from cached user JSON; if backend roles update, the client retains stale claims and sends incorrect authorization headers. No device binding, session revocation, or WebAuthn integration exists.
- **Third-party SDK bootstrapping is incomplete.** Agora, Mapbox, Google OAuth, and analytics imports assume keys exist. Missing configuration triggers runtime errors during SSR/CI, and there are no feature flags to degrade gracefully.
- **File upload integrations are unsafe.** Upload components accept any file type/size, post directly to the backend, and lack progress/error handling. Without signed URLs or virus scanning, the integration is not enterprise ready.
- **Collaboration with backend/mobile is unstructured.** There is no shared TypeScript client or schema. API updates require manual propagation, raising integration drift and defect rates.
- **CMS and blog tooling is stubbed.** Blog routes render static markdown; there is no content source integration or caching, forcing manual deployments for copy changes.
- **Search and analytics dependencies leak into the UI.** Components import enums straight from `src/constants/search.js`, but there is no guarantee the backend honours those filters. API mismatches surface as empty states with no fallbacks.
- **Feature flags are fictional.** `useFeatureFlag` hooks read from local JSON mocks and never hit a remote service, yet components branch on these flags. Teams cannot coordinate phased rollouts or measure adoption.

## Security
- **Token storage relies on `localStorage`.** `apiClient.js` stores JWTs in localStorage, exposing tokens to XSS and lacking httpOnly protection. There is no session timeout UI or forced logout for compromised sessions.
- **Route protection is client-only.** Authorization checks happen exclusively in React components. Without server-side enforcement, malicious users can manipulate local storage to unlock privileged routes.
- **Input sanitization is minimal.** Rich text editors and messaging components render user-generated HTML with inconsistent DOMPurify usage, opening XSS vectors once connected to live data.
- **Dependency security tooling is absent.** No lint rules enforce safe patterns, no Content Security Policy is configured, and no automated audits run during builds.
- **Secrets exposure risk.** API keys for Mapbox and other providers are bundled into the frontend build. There is no proxying strategy or runtime configuration to keep secrets server-side.
- **Account recovery journeys are missing.** Users cannot manage 2FA, reset passwords, or revoke sessions from the web client, leaving security workflows incomplete.
- **Telemetry payloads leak PII.** When analytics is enabled locally, events capture full session objects and query strings without redaction, violating privacy commitments once real tracking hooks are wired up.

## Alignment
- **Product promises outpace implementation.** The UI suggests a mature enterprise platform, yet mission-critical flows (analytics, collaboration, compliance dashboards) are stubs. Stakeholders expecting parity with backend capabilities will lose trust.
- **Accessibility and inclusivity goals are unmet.** Marketing highlights inclusive design, but the lack of WCAG compliance, localization, and responsive layouts contradicts that commitment.
- **Operational readiness is lacking.** Without observability, testing, or deployment tooling, the frontend cannot meet enterprise SLAs. Roadmap milestones must be re-scoped to address foundational gaps.
- **Design system governance is absent.** Fragmented component patterns contradict the stated goal of a unified brand experience, increasing future rework.
- **Marketing claims of rapid iteration ring hollow.** Every homepage copy change requires a code deployment because `HomePage.jsx` inlines all text. Growth teams cannot run experiments or tailor experiences without engineering support, slowing enterprise onboarding.
