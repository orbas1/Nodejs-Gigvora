# Version 1.50 Pre-Update Issue List

1. Authentication flows across backend, web, and mobile are mocked or incomplete, leaving state-changing routes unprotected and preventing token issuance or storage.
2. Core data model lacks critical entities (applications, messaging, notifications, analytics, provider tooling) and suffers from integrity defects such as missing constraints, auditing fields, and valid seed data.
3. Backend APIs return raw entities without pagination or business workflows, while client apps depend on static data with no error/loading states or guarded navigation.
4. Tooling and dependency configuration is inconsistent—missing migration scripts, environment samples, version pinning, and lint/test automation—hindering onboarding and CI/CD adoption.
5. Security controls are absent: hashed passwords leak in responses, 2FA secrets are stored in plaintext, and client/admin routes lack authentication guards or secure storage paths.
6. Product experiences and analytics instrumentation do not align with roadmap promises of cross-platform parity, collaboration tooling, or data-driven iteration.
