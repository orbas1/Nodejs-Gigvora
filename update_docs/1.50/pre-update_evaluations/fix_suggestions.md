# Version 1.50 Pre-Update Fix Suggestions

1. **Backend & Authentication Hardening**
   1. Implement full authentication lifecycle support: validate registration payloads by persona, issue JWT/refresh token pairs, persist refresh metadata, and add middleware guards for protected routes.
   2. Replace plaintext two-factor storage with hashed tokens, TTL enforcement, retry throttling, and pluggable delivery providers (email/SMS) to enable end-to-end verification tests.
   3. Introduce structured error handling with consistent status codes and response envelopes that omit sensitive fields (e.g., hashed passwords) from controller outputs.

2. **Data Model & Persistence Expansion**
   1. Add migrations for missing domain entities (applications, messaging, notifications, analytics, provider tooling) with relational links to existing users, jobs, and marketplace resources.
   2. Enforce integrity via composite uniqueness constraints, auditing timestamps, soft-deletion columns, and realistic seed data that bcrypt can validate.
   3. Provide lookup tables for ENUM-like fields and materialized views or indices to support discovery, analytics, and cross-channel parity promised in roadmap collateral.

3. **API & Client Feature Enablement**
   1. Extend backend endpoints with pagination, filtering, and business workflows (e.g., connection approvals, gig applications) aligned to UX copy.
   2. Build shared API clients/state management layers (Axios services for React, repository/providers for Flutter) with loading, error, and empty-state handling.
   3. Implement guarded routing, role-based navigation, and retry-aware form handling so both web and mobile clients respect authentication state.

4. **Tooling, Dependency, and CI/CD Alignment**
   1. Add `sequelize-cli` scripts, environment sample files, Node/Flutter version pinning, and project-level lint/test tooling to stabilize development environments.
   2. Configure automated pipelines for migrations, tests, linting, and dependency audits (npm/yarn/Flutter) to catch supply-chain and integration issues early.
   3. Document lockfile strategy and onboarding steps, including iOS/Android setup, so multi-platform contributors can bootstrap consistently.

5. **Security & Compliance Reinforcement**
   1. Introduce input validation, rate limiting, and secret scanning dependencies; enforce HTTPS/CSP guidance in the front end and secure storage packages in Flutter.
   2. Add role-based access controls, admin segregation, and audit logging hooks across backend routes, database tables, and mobile/web navigation flows.
   3. Establish monitoring/alerting integrations (analytics, crash reporting, feature flags) to substantiate roadmap commitments around data-driven iteration and operational oversight.
