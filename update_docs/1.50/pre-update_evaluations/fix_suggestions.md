# Fix Suggestions â€“ Version 1.50 Pre-Update Evaluations

## Backend Stabilization & Security
1. **Decouple service lifecycles.** Split background workers from the HTTP process, add readiness/liveness probes, and implement graceful shutdown handlers that close Sequelize pools, queues, and cache clients before exiting.
2. **Introduce rigorous request validation.** Adopt middleware such as Celebrate/Zod to validate payloads and enforce business rules, wrapping payment, escrow, and compliance transitions in dedicated domain services with guardrails and audit logging.
3. **Modularize the domain layer.** Break `src/models/index.js` into bounded contexts with clear association registration, eliminate duplicated definitions in `messagingModels.js`, and generate OpenAPI/JSON schemas for downstream consumers.
4. **Repair error handling and middleware.** Correct the Express error handler signature, enforce JSON/body size limits, add compression/trust proxy settings, and standardize controller/service boundaries so partially implemented routes are feature-flagged until production ready.
5. **Harden perimeter defences.** Enforce strict CORS origin lists, add `helmet` CSP/HSTS policies, apply rate limiting/abuse detection, hash all OTP/reset tokens, redact session metadata, and centralize secrets in a vault-backed configuration service.
6. **Invest in observability.** Instrument structured logging with correlation IDs, emit metrics/traces for workers and API calls, add per-router logging to detect silent failures, and surface incidents to alerting dashboards instead of console logs.

## Dependency Governance & Tooling
7. **Establish shared contract packages.** Publish versioned schema/client libraries (TypeScript + Dart) from a single source of truth so all surfaces consume consistent enums and DTOs.
8. **Complete third-party integrations safely.** Install and configure Stripe, Cloudflare R2, Agora, Mapbox, and other promised SDKs behind feature flags with credential detection, fallbacks, and automated integration tests.
9. **Adopt deterministic toolchains.** Commit clean lockfiles, define engine versions (`.nvmrc`, `.tool-versions`, `.flutter-version`), enable Dependabot/Renovate, and integrate `npm audit`, `snyk`, and `flutter pub outdated` into CI.
10. **Introduce workspace orchestration.** Use pnpm/Turborepo for JS projects and Melos for Flutter to standardize scripts, caching, and release pipelines; remove committed `node_modules/` directories and document bootstrap steps.
11. **Provide platform shims and binaries.** Configure Vite/webpack and Flutter builds with the necessary polyfills, worker loaders, and environment mocks for Mapbox, Agora, and other heavy SDKs, and publish Docker/tooling images so partners can reproduce builds.
12. **Enforce secret hygiene.** Replace demo JWTs and API keys in source and `.env.example` with stub placeholders plus vault documentation; add pre-commit/CI checks that block accidental secret commits.

## Data Governance & Reliability
13. **Align schema with models.** Refactor migrations to cover all fields/enums referenced in models, add foreign keys, composite indexes, soft-delete columns, tenant identifiers, analytics summary tables, and generate ERDs/data dictionaries.
14. **Validate migrations continuously.** Run migration smoke tests against MySQL/PostgreSQL and SQLite in CI, replace `sequelize.sync({ force: true })` with migration-based test bootstraps, tune connection pools, and introduce rollback tooling.
15. **Implement data lifecycle policies.** Define retention schedules, archival jobs, encryption-at-rest, and audit tables for financial/KYC data; add outbox/event tables for integrations and analytics.
16. **Document seeding and recovery.** Provide deterministic seed scripts, backup/restore automation, and disaster-recovery runbooks covering snapshots, point-in-time restores, and verification procedures. Ensure exports redact PII before delivery.

## Web Front-end Readiness
17. **Rationalize routing and access control.** Consolidate public/protected trees in `App.jsx`, enforce server-verified authorization, eliminate duplicate routes/providers, and introduce a guard framework shared with backend policies.
18. **Build a real data layer.** Integrate React Query (or SWR) backed by generated API clients, add error boundaries, optimistic updates, and retry/backoff logic, and replace mock data across dashboards.
19. **Elevate UX foundations.** Implement secure session handling (httpOnly cookies or refresh token services), end-to-end localization workflows, WCAG-compliant components, responsive layouts, documentation for guard components, and consistent design-system primitives.
20. **Automate quality gates.** Add Jest/React Testing Library/Cypress coverage, Storybook or Chromatic for visual regression, bundle analysis, and production build hardening (worker shims, CSP headers, tree shaking).
21. **Enable marketing agility.** Break `HomePage.jsx` and other brochure pages into CMS-driven content blocks, adopt dynamic imports for niche dashboards, and scrub analytics hooks so they redact PII before emission.

## Mobile Application Hardening
22. **Replace demo auth with production flows.** Implement proper login/refresh APIs, secure token storage (`flutter_secure_storage`), environment-specific configuration, and device posture checks.
23. **Connect features to live services.** Wire repositories to real endpoints with typed models, offline caching (Hive/SQLite), retry/backoff logic, and graceful degradation when services are unavailable.
24. **Operationalize the mobile stack.** Integrate push notifications, analytics, and crash reporting with real SDKs; add Fastlane/CI pipelines for build signing, distribution, and automated testing.
25. **Strengthen routing and UX.** Refactor `app_router.dart` to deduplicate imports, centralize guards, honour deep links, and ensure navigation responds gracefully to null sessions or permission changes. Modularize feature packages so domain logic can be reused across personas.
26. **Stabilize runtime infrastructure.** Dispose controllers/streams properly, define build flavours with environment configs, and sanitise telemetry/push payloads before transmission.

## Platform Operations & Compliance
27. **Centralize observability and incident response.** Deploy cross-platform logging/metrics/tracing, dashboards for job queues and client errors, and alert policies aligned with SLAs.
28. **Deliver governance artefacts.** Produce consent/privacy flows, audit trails, security playbooks, and compliance documentation aligned with SOC 2/GDPR commitments before onboarding enterprise tenants.
29. **Institute release management.** Create versioning, changelog, and rollback processes spanning backend, web, and mobile to ensure coordinated launches with clear stakeholder communication.
30. **Implement enterprise secret management.** Introduce vault-backed configuration, rotate credentials automatically, and add policy checks preventing hard-coded secrets from entering the repository.
