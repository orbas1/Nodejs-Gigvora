# Admin dashboard overview module

This release introduces the fully-editable admin overview panel that anchors the Gigvora control tower.

## Feature highlights

- Greeting banner driven by the signed-in admin profile with avatar, follower metrics, trust score, and ratings.
- Live date/time context and weather snapshot retrieved from Open Meteo based on stored admin location metadata.
- Modular forms that let administrators update identity, mission headline, strategic notes, and avatar/location details.
- Backend services to geocode free-form locations, fetch current weather snapshots with caching, and persist admin profile changes.
- REST endpoints and validation that secure the `/admin/dashboard` overview update workflow for privileged accounts.
- React hooks wiring for optimistic refresh, error handling, and save-status feedback throughout the overview panel.

## Next steps

- Backfill end-to-end tests covering the new overview persistence API once the sqlite fixtures mirror production schemas.
- Run the dashboard against a seeded database to validate weather lookups and rating aggregates with real data.
