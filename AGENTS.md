  - [x] Subcategory 13.C. Accessibility & Content Experience
14. **Text analysis, placement, length, redundancy, quality.** SiteDocumentLayout now uses enterprise-grade but succinct copy and live announcements to reinforce accessibility without bloating the interface. Search filters, feedback receipts, and share confirmations surface context through polished microcopy while the shared `announcePolite` helper mirrors sr-only status nodes to keep updates short for screen reader users. Headings stay within a single sentence, navigation summaries highlight mentor/founder value, and call-to-action responses reference response-time commitments to anchor trust. Focus is on action-oriented phrasing (“Link copied to clipboard.”, “Thank you for your feedback...”) with redundant adjectives stripped out to mirror LinkedIn-level tone.
1. **Appraisal.** Accessibility utilities enforce focus traps, keyboard navigation, and aria labels across modals and dropdowns.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/utils/accessibility.js†L1-L120】 The Accessibility & Content Experience stack is evaluated holistically across browser, phone, and admin personas, weighing how React shells, Flutter layouts, and server-rendered fragments reinforce a premium professional tone. Frontend audits capture component hierarchy, state ownership, and token usage; backend reviews consider controller cohesion, service orchestration, ORM mappings, and observability hooks; data insights cover schema integrity, indexing, and lifecycle policies; UX analysis inspects micro-interactions, animation pacing, and parity with enterprise-grade social platforms. Legal content journeys now synchronise metadata and feedback across the `site_pages` and `site_page_feedback` schemas, backed by aligned migrations, models, and seeders so analytics, moderation, and retention reviews operate from the same source of truth.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/database/migrations/20250322093000-site-page-feedback.cjs†L1-L78】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/siteManagementModels.js†L1-L260】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/database/seeders/20241201091500-site-legal-pages-seed.cjs†L1-L210】 The assessment also benchmarks maturity against LinkedIn-class expectations, identifying signature touches—such as hover affordances, in-card analytics, and responsive typography—that convey credibility to executives, recruiters, founders, and mentors alike.
2. **Functionality.** Content pages apply semantic HTML and structured headings. Functionality deep-dives map every request/response exchange, websocket emission, worker hand-off, and scheduled job for Accessibility & Content Experience, ensuring each persona journey flows without dead ends. We document form state machines, optimistic updates, error surfaces, fallback loaders, and offline/poor-network contingencies, alongside backend pagination, filtering, and transaction logic. Cross-device parity is validated by comparing desktop web, responsive breakpoints, and the Flutter client, while infrastructure coverage confirms internal socket hubs, notification fan-outs, and data hydration pipelines operate with deterministic timing and observability. Feedback submissions now traverse the full stack through a dedicated service and controller that hash IP data, capture role context, and persist sentiment for analytics and compliance reviews, with regression tests covering service orchestration and HTTP contracts.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/siteManagementService.js†L1000-L1070】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/siteController.js†L1-L160】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/routes/siteRoutes.js†L1-L120】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/tests/siteManagementService.test.js†L1-L81】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/tests/siteRoutes.test.js†L1-L200】 React layouts invoke the same API via `submitSitePageFeedback`, disable controls during network calls, and announce results through the global polite region so assistive tech receives consistent confirmation states.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/site/SiteDocumentLayout.jsx†L300-L520】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/services/publicSite.js†L1-L160】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/site/__tests__/SiteDocumentLayout.test.jsx†L1-L220】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/services/__tests__/publicSite.test.js†L1-L80】
5. **Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs.** Remove placeholder alt text referencing AI features. Placeholder and stub hunting for Accessibility & Content Experience scans feature flags, TODO comments, scaffolding controllers, schema columns, and UI components that render mocked data or static cards. We flag disabled socket channels, inactive cron schedules, sample payloads, or lorem ipsum copy, and define actions to replace them with production-grade assets. Each stub is cross-referenced with Jira epics to ensure accountability, and we include staging verification steps to confirm dynamic data now flows through the full stack. Document feedback forms no longer stop at toast messaging—they post to `/api/site/pages/:slug/feedback`, persist entries, and surface success or failure states validated by Vitest and Supertest, eliminating stubbed submit handlers across web and API boundaries.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/routes/siteRoutes.js†L1-L120】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/tests/siteRoutes.test.js†L1-L200】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/site/SiteDocumentLayout.jsx†L300-L560】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/site/__tests__/SiteDocumentLayout.test.jsx†L1-L220】
