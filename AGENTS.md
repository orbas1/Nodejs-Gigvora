- [x] Subcategory 5.A. Inbox & Threads
14. **Text analysis, placement, length, redundancy, quality.** Improve empty state copy to encourage building relationships by grounding every string in the executive networking narrative championed throughout `user_experience.md`. We calibrate tone to be aspirational yet direct, eliminate duplicate phrasing across message previews, and ensure progressive disclosure keeps founders and mentors oriented without crowding the viewport. UX writers partner with product marketing to curate scenario-specific microcopy—first-contact outreach, follow-up reminders, escalations—and feed localisation notes into the translation pipeline so global customers receive culturally aware guidance. All revisions undergo readability scoring, legal/privacy review for sensitive phrases, and AB testing against current baselines to confirm uplift in reply rates and sustained session depth.
   - *Voice & Tone System.* Map each Inbox & Threads string to voice pillars (Credible, Empowering, Efficient) and document acceptable variants for mentor, founder, recruiter, and admin personas.
   - *Information Architecture.* Redline subject, preview, badge, and metadata placements to minimise cognitive load while maximising scannability across dense thread lists.
   - *Empty & Error States.* Author contextual narratives for zero-state, archived, muted, and compliance-hold scenarios, reinforcing next-best actions instead of generic apologies.
   - *Guided Replies.* Craft smart suggestions and template labels that mirror the platform’s premium positioning, validating phrasing with CRM/legal stakeholders.
   - *Localization & Accessibility.* Provide translation keys, pluralisation rules, and pronunciation guidance for screen readers so international professionals experience parity.
   - *Editorial QA.* Establish linting scripts and manual checklists to flag jargon, passive constructions, or outdated CTA verbs before copy ships.
   - *Performance Feedback.* Instrument impression-to-response metrics per copy variant, feeding insights back into the UX writing backlog for continuous refinement.
