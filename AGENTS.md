1. Appraisal. The navigation shell is sprawling with inconsistent menus, multiple mega-menu variants, and redundant quick action entry points that overwhelm users instead of offering a clean LinkedIn-style bar. Branding assets are inconsistent across `Header.jsx`, `AppTopBar.jsx`, and marketing headers, leaving the top area noisy.
2. Functionality The current implementation wires role-based variants but lacks a unified state machine; responsiveness relies on ad-hoc hooks and local state rather than a shared navigation context, causing flicker between desktop and mobile menus.
3. Logic Usefulness Role toggles and quick-create shortcuts are buried; the logic duplicates permission checks in components and pages, reducing usefulness and causing divergence from backend RBAC.
4. Redundancies `HeaderMegaMenu`, `MegaMenu`, and `MobileMegaMenu` repeat menu definitions; `QuickCreateFab` overlaps with mega menu shortcuts.
5. Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs Several menu links point to `#` placeholders or stub routes (e.g., AI studio, courses, ebooks) that must be removed entirely.
6. Duplicate Functions Repeated navigation item builders exist in `AppTopBar`, `AppLayout`, and `PrimaryNavItem`; consolidate into a single navigation schema.
7. Improvements need to make Create a centralized navigation config, remove deprecated AI/course/community entries, slim down button heights, and ensure focus states align with WCAG.
8. Styling improvements Adopt a slimmer 56px top bar, remove heavy shadows, use subtle gradients, and harmonize typography with a single `font-semibold` scale.
9. Efficiency analysis and improvement Move to memoized navigation context, avoid re-render loops caused by inline arrow functions and `useEffect` watchers for window width.
10. Strengths to Keep Keep the notion of role-based navigation and quick actions but redesign as a concise icon row.
11. Weaknesses to remove Eliminate multi-tier mega menus, inconsistent iconography, and duplicated fetch triggers.
12. Styling and Colour review changes Normalize palette to neutral background with accent primary (#2563eb) and lighten hover backgrounds for clarity.
13. Css, orientation, placement and arrangement changes Switch to CSS grid for mega menu layout, align icons left, text right, remove absolute-position badges.
14. Text analysis, text placement, text length, text redundancy and quality of text analysis Rewrite labels with short, action-oriented titles; remove verbose tooltips.
15. Text Spacing Tighten letter-spacing and vertical padding to align with professional tone; ensure 8px spacing increments.
16. Shaping Round corners to 8px radius consistently instead of mixed 4px/12px.
17. Shadow, hover, glow and effects Use a single soft drop shadow (0 8px 16px rgba(15,23,42,0.08)); eliminate neon glows.
18. Thumbnails Remove mini avatars in navigation items; rely on crisp icons or initials.
19. Images and media & Images and media previews Avoid hero background images in top bar to keep load light.
20. Button styling Convert CTA buttons to slim pill-shaped 40px height with subtle border.

1.A.1 src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx
1. Appraisal. The navigation shell is sprawling with inconsistent menus, multiple mega-menu variants, and redundant quick action entry points that overwhelm users instead of offering a clean LinkedIn-style bar. Branding assets are inconsistent across `Header.jsx`, `AppTopBar.jsx`, and marketing headers, leaving the top area noisy. Component focus: src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx keeps the top-level navigation rail mixing notifications, search, and quick actions in the bloated Header & Top Navigation; rebuild it with streamlined markup, unified spacing tokens, and Figma-sourced hierarchy.
2. Functionality The current implementation wires role-based variants but lacks a unified state machine; responsiveness relies on ad-hoc hooks and local state rather than a shared navigation context, causing flicker between desktop and mobile menus. Component focus: src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx must hook into the centralized Header & Top Navigation state machine instead of keeping ad-hoc handlers so interactions stay in sync across desktop and mobile.
3. Logic Usefulness Role toggles and quick-create shortcuts are buried; the logic duplicates permission checks in components and pages, reducing usefulness and causing divergence from backend RBAC. Component focus: src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx should defer business logic to shared hooks/services; keep only view logic so usefulness lines up with backend RBAC and context providers.
4. Redundancies `HeaderMegaMenu`, `MegaMenu`, and `MobileMegaMenu` repeat menu definitions; `QuickCreateFab` overlaps with mega menu shortcuts. Component focus: src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx currently duplicates flows across sibling modules; collapse it into the single navigation schema and remove stray shortcuts.
5. Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs Several menu links point to `#` placeholders or stub routes (e.g., AI studio, courses, ebooks) that must be removed entirely. Component focus: src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx still renders placeholders or AI/course/ebook links; strip those routes and ensure only live experiences remain.
6. Duplicate Functions Repeated navigation item builders exist in `AppTopBar`, `AppLayout`, and `PrimaryNavItem`; consolidate into a single navigation schema. Component focus: src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx reimplements helper functions locally; shift those into shared utilities to prevent divergence.
7. Improvements need to make Create a centralized navigation config, remove deprecated AI/course/community entries, slim down button heights, and ensure focus states align with WCAG. Component focus: src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx needs a rebuild following the new blueprint with TypeScript props, design tokens, and RTL support baked in.
8. Styling improvements Adopt a slimmer 56px top bar, remove heavy shadows, use subtle gradients, and harmonize typography with a single `font-semibold` scale. Component focus: src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx should adopt neutral background, 8px radius, and 48px rhythm so the Header & Top Navigation feels premium.
9. Efficiency analysis and improvement Move to memoized navigation context, avoid re-render loops caused by inline arrow functions and `useEffect` watchers for window width. Component focus: src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx must memoize heavy lists, lazy-load assets, and share data fetching hooks to keep the shell responsive.
10. Strengths to Keep Keep the notion of role-based navigation and quick actions but redesign as a concise icon row. Component focus: src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx already communicates the core story; preserve the clarity but align iconography and copy tone with the refreshed brand.
11. Weaknesses to remove Eliminate multi-tier mega menus, inconsistent iconography, and duplicated fetch triggers. Component focus: src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx carries legacy gradients, noise, or multi-column chaos; remove them to eliminate the weak points flagged here.
12. Styling and Colour review changes Normalize palette to neutral background with accent primary (#2563eb) and lighten hover backgrounds for clarity. Component focus: src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx should swap to the navy/sky/slate palette with accent coral, ensuring contrast meets WCAG.
13. Css, orientation, placement and arrangement changes Switch to CSS grid for mega menu layout, align icons left, text right, remove absolute-position badges. Component focus: src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx needs responsive grid/flex layouts with defined breakpoints so spacing is consistent across viewports.
14. Text analysis, text placement, text length, text redundancy and quality of text analysis Rewrite labels with short, action-oriented titles; remove verbose tooltips. Component focus: src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx must rewrite headings and helper copy to be concise, action-oriented, and free of placeholder jargon.
15. Text Spacing Tighten letter-spacing and vertical padding to align with professional tone; ensure 8px spacing increments. Component focus: src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx should align typography to 1.5 line-height and 8/16px spacing increments to avoid cramped stacks.
16. Shaping Round corners to 8px radius consistently instead of mixed 4px/12px. Component focus: src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx needs consistent 8-12px radii and slender silhouettes so everything feels slim and professional.
17. Shadow, hover, glow and effects Use a single soft drop shadow (0 8px 16px rgba(15,23,42,0.08)); eliminate neon glows. Component focus: src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx must drop neon glows; use subtle 0 8px 16px shadows and tactile hover/focus states only where necessary.
18. Thumbnails Remove mini avatars in navigation items; rely on crisp icons or initials. Component focus: src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx should load 3:2 or 1:1 thumbnails via the media pipeline; otherwise hide empty containers gracefully.
19. Images and media & Images and media previews Avoid hero background images in top bar to keep load light. Component focus: src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx has to request optimized WebP/AVIF assets, fallback icons, and skeleton loaders for media-heavy blocks.
20. Button styling Convert CTA buttons to slim pill-shaped 40px height with subtle border. Component focus: src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx should align button heights to 40-44px, adopt primary/secondary/tertiary tokens, and support icon-leading CTAs.
21. Interactiveness Add keyboard focus outlines, aria-expanded states, and reduce hover-based only menus. Component focus: src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx must expose keyboard shortcuts, aria labeling, focus rings, and restful micro-interactions aligned to the new motion spec.
22. Missing Components Add a global search bar with predictive results powered by internal index, not Meilisearch. Component focus: src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx needs to surface any missing states—empty, loading, error—and add quick actions promised in the redesign roadmap.
23. Design Changes Introduce pinned notifications icon with counter, reorganize user menu into tidy dropdown. Component focus: src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx should restructure markup to match the modular IA: hero > context > actions > feed, ensuring content groups breathe.
24. Design Duplication Remove duplicate `Header.jsx` vs `AppTopBar.jsx` by merging marketing and app shells. Component focus: src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx must consolidate duplicates by reusing the shared UI kit primitives instead of custom wrappers.
25. Design framework Establish a design token file for spacing, colors, typography consumed by navigation components. Component focus: src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx has to import the new design tokens package, consume typography/color/spacing maps, and document any overrides.
26. Mobile App Functionality Sync navigation routes with Flutter drawer and bottom nav for parity. Component focus: src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx must ensure APIs and sockets feed the Flutter app parity by returning normalized payloads and state events.
27. Mobile App Styling Match top app bar to mobile 48px height with icons aligned. Component focus: src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx needs to match Flutter spacing/typography tokens so cross-platform experiences look native yet unified.
28. Change Checklist Tracker Extensive Inventory all routes, map to new config, QA keyboard nav, update Cypress tests, regenerate snapshots, update docs. Component focus: src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx requires a tracked checklist—component spec, Figma sign-off, unit tests, Storybook/Chromatic, QA signoff—before release.
29. Full Upgrade Plan & Release Steps  Extensive Stage navigation redesign behind feature flag, migrate marketing pages first, then authenticated shell, update backend link metadata, deploy to staging, run usability tests, roll out gradually. Component focus: src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx should ship via phased rollout: behind feature flag, gradual cohort exposure, telemetry review, and final enablement.

Component focus: src/components/navigation/PrimaryNavItem.jsx must memoize heavy lists, lazy-load assets, and share data fetching hooks to keep the shell responsive.
10. Strengths to Keep Keep the notion of role-based navigation and quick actions but redesign as a concise icon row. Component focus: src/components/navigation/PrimaryNavItem.jsx already communicates the core story; preserve the clarity but align iconography and copy tone with the refreshed brand.
11. Weaknesses to remove Eliminate multi-tier mega menus, inconsistent iconography, and duplicated fetch triggers. Component focus: src/components/navigation/PrimaryNavItem.jsx carries legacy gradients, noise, or multi-column chaos; remove them to eliminate the weak points flagged here.
12. Styling and Colour review changes Normalize palette to neutral background with accent primary (#2563eb) and lighten hover backgrounds for clarity. Component focus: src/components/navigation/PrimaryNavItem.jsx should swap to the navy/sky/slate palette with accent coral, ensuring contrast meets WCAG.
13. Css, orientation, placement and arrangement changes Switch to CSS grid for mega menu layout, align icons left, text right, remove absolute-position badges. Component focus: src/components/navigation/PrimaryNavItem.jsx needs responsive grid/flex layouts with defined breakpoints so spacing is consistent across viewports.
14. Text analysis, text placement, text length, text redundancy and quality of text analysis Rewrite labels with short, action-oriented titles; remove verbose tooltips. Component focus: src/components/navigation/PrimaryNavItem.jsx must rewrite headings and helper copy to be concise, action-oriented, and free of placeholder jargon.
15. Text Spacing Tighten letter-spacing and vertical padding to align with professional tone; ensure 8px spacing increments. Component focus: src/components/navigation/PrimaryNavItem.jsx should align typography to 1.5 line-height and 8/16px spacing increments to avoid cramped stacks.
16. Shaping Round corners to 8px radius consistently instead of mixed 4px/12px. Component focus: src/components/navigation/PrimaryNavItem.jsx needs consistent 8-12px radii and slender silhouettes so everything feels slim and professional.
17. Shadow, hover, glow and effects Use a single soft drop shadow (0 8px 16px rgba(15,23,42,0.08)); eliminate neon glows. Component focus: src/components/navigation/PrimaryNavItem.jsx must drop neon glows; use subtle 0 8px 16px shadows and tactile hover/focus states only where necessary.
18. Thumbnails Remove mini avatars in navigation items; rely on crisp icons or initials. Component focus: src/components/navigation/PrimaryNavItem.jsx should load 3:2 or 1:1 thumbnails via the media pipeline; otherwise hide empty containers gracefully.
19. Images and media & Images and media previews Avoid hero background images in top bar to keep load light. Component focus: src/components/navigation/PrimaryNavItem.jsx has to request optimized WebP/AVIF assets, fallback icons, and skeleton loaders for media-heavy blocks.
20. Button styling Convert CTA buttons to slim pill-shaped 40px height with subtle border. Component focus: src/components/navigation/PrimaryNavItem.jsx should align button heights to 40-44px, adopt primary/secondary/tertiary tokens, and support icon-leading CTAs.
21. Interactiveness Add keyboard focus outlines, aria-expanded states, and reduce hover-based only menus. Component focus: src/components/navigation/PrimaryNavItem.jsx must expose keyboard shortcuts, aria labeling, focus rings, and restful micro-interactions aligned to the new motion spec.
22. Missing Components Add a global search bar with predictive results powered by internal index, not Meilisearch. Component focus: src/components/navigation/PrimaryNavItem.jsx needs to surface any missing states—empty, loading, error—and add quick actions promised in the redesign roadmap.
23. Design Changes Introduce pinned notifications icon with counter, reorganize user menu into tidy dropdown. Component focus: src/components/navigation/PrimaryNavItem.jsx should restructure markup to match the modular IA: hero > context > actions > feed, ensuring content groups breathe.
24. Design Duplication Remove duplicate `Header.jsx` vs `AppTopBar.jsx` by merging marketing and app shells. Component focus: src/components/navigation/PrimaryNavItem.jsx must consolidate duplicates by reusing the shared UI kit primitives instead of custom wrappers.
25. Design framework Establish a design token file for spacing, colors, typography consumed by navigation components. Component focus: src/components/navigation/PrimaryNavItem.jsx has to import the new design tokens package, consume typography/color/spacing maps, and document any overrides.
26. Mobile App Functionality Sync navigation routes with Flutter drawer and bottom nav for parity. Component focus: src/components/navigation/PrimaryNavItem.jsx must ensure APIs and sockets feed the Flutter app parity by returning normalized payloads and state events.
27. Mobile App Styling Match top app bar to mobile 48px height with icons aligned. Component focus: src/components/navigation/PrimaryNavItem.jsx needs to match Flutter spacing/typography tokens so cross-platform experiences look native yet unified.
28. Change Checklist Tracker Extensive Inventory all routes, map to new config, QA keyboard nav, update Cypress tests, regenerate snapshots, update docs. Component focus: src/components/navigation/PrimaryNavItem.jsx requires a tracked checklist—component spec, Figma sign-off, unit tests, Storybook/Chromatic, QA signoff—before release.
29. Full Upgrade Plan & Release Steps  Extensive Stage navigation redesign behind feature flag, migrate marketing pages first, then authenticated shell, update backend link metadata, deploy to staging, run usability tests, roll out gradually. Component focus: src/components/navigation/PrimaryNavItem.jsx should ship via phased rollout: behind feature flag, gradual cohort exposure, telemetry review, and final enablement.

1.A.5 src/components/navigation/RoleSwitcher.jsx
1. Appraisal. The navigation shell is sprawling with inconsistent menus, multiple mega-menu variants, and redundant quick action entry points that overwhelm users instead of offering a clean LinkedIn-style bar. Branding assets are inconsistent across `Header.jsx`, `AppTopBar.jsx`, and marketing headers, leaving the top area noisy. Component focus: src/components/navigation/RoleSwitcher.jsx keeps the role toggle control handling multiple personas in the bloated Header & Top Navigation; rebuild it with streamlined markup, unified spacing tokens, and Figma-sourced hierarchy.
2. Functionality The current implementation wires role-based variants but lacks a unified state machine; responsiveness relies on ad-hoc hooks and local state rather than a shared navigation context, causing flicker between desktop and mobile menus. Component focus: src/components/navigation/RoleSwitcher.jsx must hook into the centralized Header & Top Navigation state machine instead of keeping ad-hoc handlers so interactions stay in sync across desktop and mobile.
3. Logic Usefulness Role toggles and quick-create shortcuts are buried; the logic duplicates permission checks in components and pages, reducing usefulness and causing divergence from backend RBAC. Component focus: src/components/navigation/RoleSwitcher.jsx should defer business logic to shared hooks/services; keep only view logic so usefulness lines up with backend RBAC and context providers.
4. Redundancies `HeaderMegaMenu`, `MegaMenu`, and `MobileMegaMenu` repeat menu definitions; `QuickCreateFab` overlaps with mega menu shortcuts. Component focus: src/components/navigation/RoleSwitcher.jsx currently duplicates flows across sibling modules; collapse it into the single navigation schema and remove stray shortcuts.
5. Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs Several menu links point to `#` placeholders or stub routes (e.g., AI studio, courses, ebooks) that must be removed entirely. Component focus: src/components/navigation/RoleSwitcher.jsx still renders placeholders or AI/course/ebook links; strip those routes and ensure only live experiences remain.
6. Duplicate Functions Repeated navigation item builders exist in `AppTopBar`, `AppLayout`, and `PrimaryNavItem`; consolidate into a single navigation schema. Component focus: src/components/navigation/RoleSwitcher.jsx reimplements helper functions locally; shift those into shared utilities to prevent divergence.
7. Improvements need to make Create a centralized navigation config, remove deprecated AI/course/community entries, slim down button heights, and ensure focus states align with WCAG. Component focus: src/components/navigation/RoleSwitcher.jsx needs a rebuild following the new blueprint with TypeScript props, design tokens, and RTL support baked in.
8. Styling improvements Adopt a slimmer 56px top bar, remove heavy shadows, use subtle gradients, and harmonize typography with a single `font-semibold` scale. Component focus: src/components/navigation/RoleSwitcher.jsx should adopt neutral background, 8px radius, and 48px rhythm so the Header & Top Navigation feels premium.
9. Efficiency analysis and improvement Move to memoized navigation context, avoid re-render loops caused by inline arrow functions and `useEffect` watchers for window width.

Component focus: src/components/navigation/QuickCreateFab.jsx needs a rebuild following the new blueprint with TypeScript props, design tokens, and RTL support baked in.
8. Styling improvements Adopt a slimmer 56px top bar, remove heavy shadows, use subtle gradients, and harmonize typography with a single `font-semibold` scale. Component focus: src/components/navigation/QuickCreateFab.jsx should adopt neutral background, 8px radius, and 48px rhythm so the Header & Top Navigation feels premium.
9. Efficiency analysis and improvement Move to memoized navigation context, avoid re-render loops caused by inline arrow functions and `useEffect` watchers for window width. Component focus: src/components/navigation/QuickCreateFab.jsx must memoize heavy lists, lazy-load assets, and share data fetching hooks to keep the shell responsive.
10. Strengths to Keep Keep the notion of role-based navigation and quick actions but redesign as a concise icon row. Component focus: src/components/navigation/QuickCreateFab.jsx already communicates the core story; preserve the clarity but align iconography and copy tone with the refreshed brand.
11. Weaknesses to remove Eliminate multi-tier mega menus, inconsistent iconography, and duplicated fetch triggers. Component focus: src/components/navigation/QuickCreateFab.jsx carries legacy gradients, noise, or multi-column chaos; remove them to eliminate the weak points flagged here.
12. Styling and Colour review changes Normalize palette to neutral background with accent primary (#2563eb) and lighten hover backgrounds for clarity. Component focus: src/components/navigation/QuickCreateFab.jsx should swap to the navy/sky/slate palette with accent coral, ensuring contrast meets WCAG.
13. Css, orientation, placement and arrangement changes Switch to CSS grid for mega menu layout, align icons left, text right, remove absolute-position badges. Component focus: src/components/navigation/QuickCreateFab.jsx needs responsive grid/flex layouts with defined breakpoints so spacing is consistent across viewports.
14. Text analysis, text placement, text length, text redundancy and quality of text analysis Rewrite labels with short, action-oriented titles; remove verbose tooltips. Component focus: src/components/navigation/QuickCreateFab.jsx must rewrite headings and helper copy to be concise, action-oriented, and free of placeholder jargon.
15. Text Spacing Tighten letter-spacing and vertical padding to align with professional tone; ensure 8px spacing increments. Component focus: src/components/navigation/QuickCreateFab.jsx should align typography to 1.5 line-height and 8/16px spacing increments to avoid cramped stacks.
16. Shaping Round corners to 8px radius consistently instead of mixed 4px/12px. Component focus: src/components/navigation/QuickCreateFab.jsx needs consistent 8-12px radii and slender silhouettes so everything feels slim and professional.
17. Shadow, hover, glow and effects Use a single soft drop shadow (0 8px 16px rgba(15,23,42,0.08)); eliminate neon glows. Component focus: src/components/navigation/QuickCreateFab.jsx must drop neon glows; use subtle 0 8px 16px shadows and tactile hover/focus states only where necessary.
18. Thumbnails Remove mini avatars in navigation items; rely on crisp icons or initials. Component focus: src/components/navigation/QuickCreateFab.jsx should load 3:2 or 1:1 thumbnails via the media pipeline; otherwise hide empty containers gracefully.
19. Images and media & Images and media previews Avoid hero background images in top bar to keep load light. Component focus: src/components/navigation/QuickCreateFab.jsx has to request optimized WebP/AVIF assets, fallback icons, and skeleton loaders for media-heavy blocks.
20. Button styling Convert CTA buttons to slim pill-shaped 40px height with subtle border. Component focus: src/components/navigation/QuickCreateFab.jsx should align button heights to 40-44px, adopt primary/secondary/tertiary tokens, and support icon-leading CTAs.
21. Interactiveness Add keyboard focus outlines, aria-expanded states, and reduce hover-based only menus. Component focus: src/components/navigation/QuickCreateFab.jsx must expose keyboard shortcuts, aria labeling, focus rings, and restful micro-interactions aligned to the new motion spec.
22. Missing Components Add a global search bar with predictive results powered by internal index, not Meilisearch. Component focus: src/components/navigation/QuickCreateFab.jsx needs to surface any missing states—empty, loading, error—and add quick actions promised in the redesign roadmap.
23. Design Changes Introduce pinned notifications icon with counter, reorganize user menu into tidy dropdown. Component focus: src/components/navigation/QuickCreateFab.jsx should restructure markup to match the modular IA: hero > context > actions > feed, ensuring content groups breathe.
24. Design Duplication Remove duplicate `Header.jsx` vs `AppTopBar.jsx` by merging marketing and app shells. Component focus: src/components/navigation/QuickCreateFab.jsx must consolidate duplicates by reusing the shared UI kit primitives instead of custom wrappers.
25. Design framework Establish a design token file for spacing, colors, typography consumed by navigation components. Component focus: src/components/navigation/QuickCreateFab.jsx has to import the new design tokens package, consume typography/color/spacing maps, and document any overrides.
26. Mobile App Functionality Sync navigation routes with Flutter drawer and bottom nav for parity. Component focus: src/components/navigation/QuickCreateFab.jsx must ensure APIs and sockets feed the Flutter app parity by returning normalized payloads and state events.
27. Mobile App Styling Match top app bar to mobile 48px height with icons aligned. Component focus: src/components/navigation/QuickCreateFab.jsx needs to match Flutter spacing/typography tokens so cross-platform experiences look native yet unified.
28. Change Checklist Tracker Extensive Inventory all routes, map to new config, QA keyboard nav, update Cypress tests, regenerate snapshots, update docs. Component focus: src/components/navigation/QuickCreateFab.jsx requires a tracked checklist—component spec, Figma sign-off, unit tests, Storybook/Chromatic, QA signoff—before release.
29. Full Upgrade Plan & Release Steps  Extensive Stage navigation redesign behind feature flag, migrate marketing pages first, then authenticated shell, update backend link metadata, deploy to staging, run usability tests, roll out gradually. Component focus: src/components/navigation/QuickCreateFab.jsx should ship via phased rollout: behind feature flag, gradual cohort exposure, telemetry review, and final enablement.

1.A.9 src/components/site/SiteHeader.jsx
1. Appraisal. The navigation shell is sprawling with inconsistent menus, multiple mega-menu variants, and redundant quick action entry points that overwhelm users instead of offering a clean LinkedIn-style bar. Branding assets are inconsistent across `Header.jsx`, `AppTopBar.jsx`, and marketing headers, leaving the top area noisy. Component focus: src/components/site/SiteHeader.jsx keeps the marketing site header wrapper in the bloated Header & Top Navigation; rebuild it with streamlined markup, unified spacing tokens, and Figma-sourced hierarchy.
2. Functionality The current implementation wires role-based variants but lacks a unified state machine; responsiveness relies on ad-hoc hooks and local state rather than a shared navigation context, causing flicker between desktop and mobile menus. Component focus: src/components/site/SiteHeader.jsx must hook into the centralized Header & Top Navigation state machine instead of keeping ad-hoc handlers so interactions stay in sync across desktop and mobile.
3. Logic Usefulness Role toggles and quick-create shortcuts are buried; the logic duplicates permission checks in components and pages, reducing usefulness and causing divergence from backend RBAC. Component focus: src/components/site/SiteHeader.jsx should defer business logic to shared hooks/services; keep only view logic so usefulness lines up with backend RBAC and context providers.
4. Redundancies `HeaderMegaMenu`, `MegaMenu`, and `MobileMegaMenu` repeat menu definitions; `QuickCreateFab` overlaps with mega menu shortcuts. Component focus: src/components/site/SiteHeader.jsx currently duplicates flows across sibling modules; collapse it into the single navigation schema and remove stray shortcuts.
5. Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs Several menu links point to `#` placeholders or stub routes (e.g., AI studio, courses, ebooks) that must be removed entirely. Component focus: src/components/site/SiteHeader.jsx still renders placeholders or AI/course/ebook links; strip those routes and ensure only live experiences remain.
6. Duplicate Functions Repeated navigation item builders exist in `AppTopBar`, `AppLayout`, and `PrimaryNavItem`; consolidate into a single navigation schema.

1.C.7 src/components/ui/SectionCard.jsx
1. Appraisal. Layouts are inconsistent with nested padding rules and conflicting background colors. Component focus: src/components/ui/SectionCard.jsx keeps the card wrapper for dashboard/marketing sections in the bloated Layout Containers; rebuild it with streamlined markup, unified spacing tokens, and Figma-sourced hierarchy.
2. Functionality Layout components mix data fetching and layout responsibilities, hindering reuse. Component focus: src/components/ui/SectionCard.jsx must hook into the centralized Layout Containers state machine instead of keeping ad-hoc handlers so interactions stay in sync across desktop and mobile.
3. Logic Usefulness Dashboard layout duplicates aside nav logic; Onboarding layout minimal. Component focus: src/components/ui/SectionCard.jsx should defer business logic to shared hooks/services; keep only view logic so usefulness lines up with backend RBAC and context providers.
4. Redundancies Multiple wrappers apply similar container max widths. Component focus: src/components/ui/SectionCard.jsx currently duplicates flows across sibling modules; collapse it into the single navigation schema and remove stray shortcuts.
5. Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs Onboarding layout references nonexistent progress tracker. Component focus: src/components/ui/SectionCard.jsx still renders placeholders or AI/course/ebook links; strip those routes and ensure only live experiences remain.
6. Duplicate Functions Many `PageContainer` clones exist across pages. Component focus: src/components/ui/SectionCard.jsx reimplements helper functions locally; shift those into shared utilities to prevent divergence.
7. Improvements need to make Centralize layout system with slot-based composition and theming. Component focus: src/components/ui/SectionCard.jsx needs a rebuild following the new blueprint with TypeScript props, design tokens, and RTL support baked in.
8. Styling improvements Standardize max-width, background, spacing tokens. Component focus: src/components/ui/SectionCard.jsx should adopt neutral background, 8px radius, and 48px rhythm so the Layout Containers feels premium.
9. Efficiency analysis and improvement Remove unnecessary re-renders from context providers defined inside layouts. Component focus: src/components/ui/SectionCard.jsx must memoize heavy lists, lazy-load assets, and share data fetching hooks to keep the shell responsive.
10. Strengths to Keep Keep `PageContainer` concept for consistent gutters. Component focus: src/components/ui/SectionCard.jsx already communicates the core story; preserve the clarity but align iconography and copy tone with the refreshed brand.
11. Weaknesses to remove Remove inline `style` overrides and redundant wrappers. Component focus: src/components/ui/SectionCard.jsx carries legacy gradients, noise, or multi-column chaos; remove them to eliminate the weak points flagged here.

2. Functionality Animations heavy; reliance on scroll-triggered effects without optimization. Component focus: src/components/marketing/PricingPlans.jsx must hook into the centralized Home & Hero Pages state machine instead of keeping ad-hoc handlers so interactions stay in sync across desktop and mobile.
3. Logic Usefulness Value props are generic; lacks clear differentiation for mentors/groups. Component focus: src/components/marketing/PricingPlans.jsx should defer business logic to shared hooks/services; keep only view logic so usefulness lines up with backend RBAC and context providers.
4. Redundancies Duplicate `HomePage` vs `home/HomePage` and repeated sections. Component focus: src/components/marketing/PricingPlans.jsx currently duplicates flows across sibling modules; collapse it into the single navigation schema and remove stray shortcuts.
5. Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs Testimonials use placeholder avatars and lorem ipsum. Component focus: src/components/marketing/PricingPlans.jsx still renders placeholders or AI/course/ebook links; strip those routes and ensure only live experiences remain.
6. Duplicate Functions Multiple FAQ accordions across marketing pages. Component focus: src/components/marketing/PricingPlans.jsx reimplements helper functions locally; shift those into shared utilities to prevent divergence.
7. Improvements need to make Rewrite story around professional networking, remove AI/course references, streamline hero copy. Component focus: src/components/marketing/PricingPlans.jsx needs a rebuild following the new blueprint with TypeScript props, design tokens, and RTL support baked in.
8. Styling improvements Use clean hero with one illustration, lighten background. Component focus: src/components/marketing/PricingPlans.jsx should adopt neutral background, 8px radius, and 48px rhythm so the Home & Hero Pages feels premium.
9. Efficiency analysis and improvement Remove heavy parallax, lazy load imagery, compress assets. Component focus: src/components/marketing/PricingPlans.jsx must memoize heavy lists, lazy-load assets, and share data fetching hooks to keep the shell responsive.

4.A.1 src/pages/dashboards/UserDashboardPage.jsx
1. Appraisal. Dashboard overloaded with widgets lacking hierarchy. Component focus: src/pages/dashboards/UserDashboardPage.jsx keeps the user dashboard landing page in the bloated User Dashboard Overview; rebuild it with streamlined markup, unified spacing tokens, and Figma-sourced hierarchy.
2. Functionality Data sources inconsistent, many rely on mocked data. Component focus: src/pages/dashboards/UserDashboardPage.jsx must hook into the centralized User Dashboard Overview state machine instead of keeping ad-hoc handlers so interactions stay in sync across desktop and mobile.
3. Logic Usefulness Widgets replicate features found elsewhere causing noise. Component focus: src/pages/dashboards/UserDashboardPage.jsx should defer business logic to shared hooks/services; keep only view logic so usefulness lines up with backend RBAC and context providers.
4. Redundancies Duplicate metrics between overview and analytics cards. Component focus: src/pages/dashboards/UserDashboardPage.jsx currently duplicates flows across sibling modules; collapse it into the single navigation schema and remove stray shortcuts.
5. Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs Several widgets show stub numbers. Component focus: src/pages/dashboards/UserDashboardPage.jsx still renders placeholders or AI/course/ebook links; strip those routes and ensure only live experiences remain.
6. Duplicate Functions Metric cards repeated in other dashboards. Component focus: src/pages/dashboards/UserDashboardPage.jsx reimplements helper functions locally; shift those into shared utilities to prevent divergence.
7. Improvements need to make Redesign dashboard as curated highlights with personalization. Component focus: src/pages/dashboards/UserDashboardPage.jsx needs a rebuild following the new blueprint with TypeScript props, design tokens, and RTL support baked in.
8. Styling improvements Use modular grid with consistent card heights. Component focus: src/pages/dashboards/UserDashboardPage.jsx should adopt neutral background, 8px radius, and 48px rhythm so the User Dashboard Overview feels premium.
9. Efficiency analysis and improvement Fetch data via aggregated endpoint to reduce API chatter. Component focus: src/pages/dashboards/UserDashboardPage.jsx must memoize heavy lists, lazy-load assets, and share data fetching hooks to keep the shell responsive.
10. Strengths to Keep Keep quick stats but make dynamic. Component focus: src/pages/dashboards/UserDashboardPage.jsx already communicates the core story; preserve the clarity but align iconography and copy tone with the refreshed brand.
11. Weaknesses to remove Remove redundant analytics, AI suggestions. Component focus: src/pages/dashboards/UserDashboardPage.jsx carries legacy gradients, noise, or multi-column chaos; remove them to eliminate the weak points flagged here.
12. Styling and Colour review changes Use minimal color, highlight key metrics. Component focus: src/pages/dashboards/UserDashboardPage.jsx should swap to the navy/sky/slate palette with accent coral, ensuring contrast meets WCAG.
13. Css, orientation, placement and arrangement changes Adopt masonry/responsive grid. Component focus: src/pages/dashboards/UserDashboardPage.jsx needs responsive grid/flex layouts with defined breakpoints so spacing is consistent across viewports.

4.A.6 src/components/userDashboard/KanbanSnapshot.jsx
1. Appraisal. Dashboard overloaded with widgets lacking hierarchy. Component focus: src/components/userDashboard/KanbanSnapshot.jsx keeps the mini kanban snapshot in the bloated User Dashboard Overview; rebuild it with streamlined markup, unified spacing tokens, and Figma-sourced hierarchy.
2. Functionality Data sources inconsistent, many rely on mocked data. Component focus: src/components/userDashboard/KanbanSnapshot.jsx must hook into the centralized User Dashboard Overview state machine instead of keeping ad-hoc handlers so interactions stay in sync across desktop and mobile.
3. Logic Usefulness Widgets replicate features found elsewhere causing noise. Component focus: src/components/userDashboard/KanbanSnapshot.jsx should defer business logic to shared hooks/services; keep only view logic so usefulness lines up with backend RBAC and context providers.
4. Redundancies Duplicate metrics between overview and analytics cards. Component focus: src/components/userDashboard/KanbanSnapshot.jsx currently duplicates flows across sibling modules; collapse it into the single navigation schema and remove stray shortcuts.
5. Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs Several widgets show stub numbers. Component focus: src/components/userDashboard/KanbanSnapshot.jsx still renders placeholders or AI/course/ebook links; strip those routes and ensure only live experiences remain.
6. Duplicate Functions Metric cards repeated in other dashboards. Component focus: src/components/userDashboard/KanbanSnapshot.jsx reimplements helper functions locally; shift those into shared utilities to prevent divergence.
7. Improvements need to make Redesign dashboard as curated highlights with personalization. Component focus: src/components/userDashboard/KanbanSnapshot.jsx needs a rebuild following the new blueprint with TypeScript props, design tokens, and RTL support baked in.
8. Styling improvements Use modular grid with consistent card heights. Component focus: src/components/userDashboard/KanbanSnapshot.jsx should adopt neutral background, 8px radius, and 48px rhythm so the User Dashboard Overview feels premium.
9. Efficiency analysis and improvement Fetch data via aggregated endpoint to reduce API chatter. Component focus: src/components/userDashboard/KanbanSnapshot.jsx must memoize heavy lists, lazy-load assets, and share data fetching hooks to keep the shell responsive.
10. Strengths to Keep Keep quick stats but make dynamic. Component focus: src/components/userDashboard/KanbanSnapshot.jsx already communicates the core story; preserve the clarity but align iconography and copy tone with the refreshed brand.
11. Weaknesses to remove Remove redundant analytics, AI suggestions. Component focus: src/components/userDashboard/KanbanSnapshot.jsx carries legacy gradients, noise, or multi-column chaos; remove them to eliminate the weak points flagged here.
12. Styling and Colour review changes Use minimal color, highlight key metrics. Component focus: src/components/userDashboard/KanbanSnapshot.jsx should swap to the navy/sky/slate palette with accent coral, ensuring contrast meets WCAG.
13. Css, orientation, placement and arrangement changes Adopt masonry/responsive grid. Component focus: src/components/userDashboard/KanbanSnapshot.jsx needs responsive grid/flex layouts with defined breakpoints so spacing is consistent across viewports.
14. Text analysis, text placement, text length, text redundancy and quality of text analysis Provide short insights, remove filler. Component focus: src/components/userDashboard/KanbanSnapshot.jsx must rewrite headings and helper copy to be concise, action-oriented, and free of placeholder jargon.
15. Text Spacing Add breathing room between cards. Component focus: src/components/userDashboard/KanbanSnapshot.jsx should align typography to 1.5 line-height and 8/16px spacing increments to avoid cramped stacks.
16. Shaping Standard 12px radius. Component focus: src/components/userDashboard/KanbanSnapshot.jsx needs consistent 8-12px radii and slender silhouettes so everything feels slim and professional.
17. Shadow, hover, glow and effects Subtle, consistent. Component focus: src/components/userDashboard/KanbanSnapshot.jsx must drop neon glows; use subtle 0 8px 16px shadows and tactile hover/focus states only where necessary.
18. Thumbnails Replace random icons with purposeful vector icons. Component focus: src/components/userDashboard/KanbanSnapshot.jsx should load 3:2 or 1:1 thumbnails via the media pipeline; otherwise hide empty containers gracefully.
19. Images and media & Images and media previews Provide relevant thumbnails for mentors/gigs only. Component focus: src/components/userDashboard/KanbanSnapshot.jsx has to request optimized WebP/AVIF assets, fallback icons, and skeleton loaders for media-heavy blocks.
20. Button styling Use ghost buttons for secondary actions. Component focus: src/components/userDashboard/KanbanSnapshot.jsx should align button heights to 40-44px, adopt primary/secondary/tertiary tokens, and support icon-leading CTAs.
21. Interactiveness Provide interactive filters with smooth transitions. Component focus: src/components/userDashboard/KanbanSnapshot.jsx must expose keyboard shortcuts, aria labeling, focus rings, and restful micro-interactions aligned to the new motion spec.
22. Missing Components Add goal tracker, recommended mentors. Component focus: src/components/userDashboard/KanbanSnapshot.jsx needs to surface any missing states—empty, loading, error—and add quick actions promised in the redesign roadmap.
23. Design Changes Create layout blueprint, limit to 6 core widgets. Component focus: src/components/userDashboard/KanbanSnapshot.jsx should restructure markup to match the modular IA: hero > context > actions > feed, ensuring content groups breathe.

4.B.1 src/pages/ProfilePage.jsx
1. Appraisal. Profile editing UI complex with overlapping tabs and inconsistent states. Component focus: src/pages/ProfilePage.jsx keeps the profile page container in the bloated Profile Hub & Editing; rebuild it with streamlined markup, unified spacing tokens, and Figma-sourced hierarchy.
2. Functionality Many sections rely on local JSON mocks; saving flows not unified. Component focus: src/pages/ProfilePage.jsx must hook into the centralized Profile Hub & Editing state machine instead of keeping ad-hoc handlers so interactions stay in sync across desktop and mobile.
3. Logic Usefulness Experience timeline duplicates data across contexts. Component focus: src/pages/ProfilePage.jsx should defer business logic to shared hooks/services; keep only view logic so usefulness lines up with backend RBAC and context providers.
4. Redundancies Separate edit and view pages share components inconsistently. Component focus: src/pages/ProfilePage.jsx currently duplicates flows across sibling modules; collapse it into the single navigation schema and remove stray shortcuts.
5. Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs Endorsement and recommendations sections stubbed. Component focus: src/pages/ProfilePage.jsx still renders placeholders or AI/course/ebook links; strip those routes and ensure only live experiences remain.
6. Duplicate Functions Skill chips repeated across modules. Component focus: src/pages/ProfilePage.jsx reimplements helper functions locally; shift those into shared utilities to prevent divergence.
7. Improvements need to make Create modular profile schema with autosave and preview. Component focus: src/pages/ProfilePage.jsx needs a rebuild following the new blueprint with TypeScript props, design tokens, and RTL support baked in.
8. Styling improvements Adopt clean LinkedIn-style sections with inline edit. Component focus: src/pages/ProfilePage.jsx should adopt neutral background, 8px radius, and 48px rhythm so the Profile Hub & Editing feels premium.
9. Efficiency analysis and improvement Use form state manager with diff patch API. Component focus: src/pages/ProfilePage.jsx must memoize heavy lists, lazy-load assets, and share data fetching hooks to keep the shell responsive.
10. Strengths to Keep Keep modular sections and highlights concept. Component focus: src/pages/ProfilePage.jsx already communicates the core story; preserve the clarity but align iconography and copy tone with the refreshed brand.
11. Weaknesses to remove Remove cluttered sidebars and redundant accordions. Component focus: src/pages/ProfilePage.jsx carries legacy gradients, noise, or multi-column chaos; remove them to eliminate the weak points flagged here.
12. Styling and Colour review changes Use white background, subtle dividers. Component focus: src/pages/ProfilePage.jsx should swap to the navy/sky/slate palette with accent coral, ensuring contrast meets WCAG.
13. Css, orientation, placement and arrangement changes Use CSS grid for two-column layout. Component focus: src/pages/ProfilePage.jsx needs responsive grid/flex layouts with defined breakpoints so spacing is consistent across viewports.
14. Text analysis, text placement, text length, text redundancy and quality of text analysis Provide purposeful descriptions. Component focus: src/pages/ProfilePage.jsx must rewrite headings and helper copy to be concise, action-oriented, and free of placeholder jargon.
15. Text Spacing Ensure consistent spacing. Component focus: src/pages/ProfilePage.jsx should align typography to 1.5 line-height and 8/16px spacing increments to avoid cramped stacks.
16. Shaping Use subtle card edges. Component focus: src/pages/ProfilePage.jsx needs consistent 8-12px radii and slender silhouettes so everything feels slim and professional.
17. Shadow, hover, glow and effects Minimal. Component focus: src/pages/ProfilePage.jsx must drop neon glows; use subtle 0 8px 16px shadows and tactile hover/focus states only where necessary.
18. Thumbnails Standardize avatar cropping. Component focus: src/pages/ProfilePage.jsx should load 3:2 or 1:1 thumbnails via the media pipeline; otherwise hide empty containers gracefully.
19. Images and media & Images and media previews Provide media gallery with consistent aspect ratio. Component focus: src/pages/ProfilePage.jsx has to request optimized WebP/AVIF assets, fallback icons, and skeleton loaders for media-heavy blocks.
20. Button styling Provide inline icon buttons for edit. Component focus: src/pages/ProfilePage.jsx should align button heights to 40-44px, adopt primary/secondary/tertiary tokens, and support icon-leading CTAs.
21. Interactiveness Add drag-and-drop reorder with accessible controls. Component focus: src/pages/ProfilePage.jsx must expose keyboard shortcuts, aria labeling, focus rings, and restful micro-interactions aligned to the new motion spec.
22. Missing Components Add profile completion tracker. Component focus: src/pages/ProfilePage.jsx needs to surface any missing states—empty, loading, error—and add quick actions promised in the redesign roadmap.
23. Design Changes Merge view/edit into single progressive experience. Component focus: src/pages/ProfilePage.jsx should restructure markup to match the modular IA: hero > context > actions > feed, ensuring content groups breathe.
24. Design Duplication Remove duplicate profile summary components. Component focus: src/pages/ProfilePage.jsx must consolidate duplicates by reusing the shared UI kit primitives instead of custom wrappers.
25. Design framework Document profile module styles. Component focus: src/pages/ProfilePage.jsx has to import the new design tokens package, consume typography/color/spacing maps, and document any overrides.
26. Mobile App Functionality Mirror sections with collapsible panels. Component focus: src/pages/ProfilePage.jsx must ensure APIs and sockets feed the Flutter app parity by returning normalized payloads and state events.
27. Mobile App Styling Keep minimalistic design. Component focus: src/pages/ProfilePage.jsx needs to match Flutter spacing/typography tokens so cross-platform experiences look native yet unified.
28. Change Checklist Tracker Extensive Audit data model, unify API, redesign UI. Component focus: src/pages/ProfilePage.jsx requires a tracked checklist—component spec, Figma sign-off, unit tests, Storybook/Chromatic, QA signoff—before release.
29. Full Upgrade Plan & Release Steps  Extensive Build new profile service, migrate data, release. Component focus: src/pages/ProfilePage.jsx should ship via phased rollout: behind feature flag, gradual cohort exposure, telemetry review, and final enablement.

Component focus: src/components/profileSettings/EndorsementsPanel.jsx keeps the endorsement panel in the bloated Profile Hub & Editing; rebuild it with streamlined markup, unified spacing tokens, and Figma-sourced hierarchy.
2. Functionality Many sections rely on local JSON mocks; saving flows not unified. Component focus: src/components/profileSettings/EndorsementsPanel.jsx must hook into the centralized Profile Hub & Editing state machine instead of keeping ad-hoc handlers so interactions stay in sync across desktop and mobile.
3. Logic Usefulness Experience timeline duplicates data across contexts. Component focus: src/components/profileSettings/EndorsementsPanel.jsx should defer business logic to shared hooks/services; keep only view logic so usefulness lines up with backend RBAC and context providers.
4. Redundancies Separate edit and view pages share components inconsistently. Component focus: src/components/profileSettings/EndorsementsPanel.jsx currently duplicates flows across sibling modules; collapse it into the single navigation schema and remove stray shortcuts.
5. Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs Endorsement and recommendations sections stubbed. Component focus: src/components/profileSettings/EndorsementsPanel.jsx still renders placeholders or AI/course/ebook links; strip those routes and ensure only live experiences remain.
6. Duplicate Functions Skill chips repeated across modules. Component focus: src/components/profileSettings/EndorsementsPanel.jsx reimplements helper functions locally; shift those into shared utilities to prevent divergence.
7. Improvements need to make Create modular profile schema with autosave and preview. Component focus: src/components/profileSettings/EndorsementsPanel.jsx needs a rebuild following the new blueprint with TypeScript props, design tokens, and RTL support baked in.
8. Styling improvements Adopt clean LinkedIn-style sections with inline edit. Component focus: src/components/profileSettings/EndorsementsPanel.jsx should adopt neutral background, 8px radius, and 48px rhythm so the Profile Hub & Editing feels premium.
9. Efficiency analysis and improvement Use form state manager with diff patch API. Component focus: src/components/profileSettings/EndorsementsPanel.jsx must memoize heavy lists, lazy-load assets, and share data fetching hooks to keep the shell responsive.
10. Strengths to Keep Keep modular sections and highlights concept. Component focus: src/components/profileSettings/EndorsementsPanel.jsx already communicates the core story; preserve the clarity but align iconography and copy tone with the refreshed brand.
11. Weaknesses to remove Remove cluttered sidebars and redundant accordions. Component focus: src/components/profileSettings/EndorsementsPanel.jsx carries legacy gradients, noise, or multi-column chaos; remove them to eliminate the weak points flagged here.
12. Styling and Colour review changes Use white background, subtle dividers. Component focus: src/components/profileSettings/EndorsementsPanel.jsx should swap to the navy/sky/slate palette with accent coral, ensuring contrast meets WCAG.
13. Css, orientation, placement and arrangement changes Use CSS grid for two-column layout. Component focus: src/components/profileSettings/EndorsementsPanel.jsx needs responsive grid/flex layouts with defined breakpoints so spacing is consistent across viewports.

15. Text Spacing Ensure consistent spacing. Component focus: src/components/profileSettings/EndorsementsPanel.jsx should align typography to 1.5 line-height and 8/16px spacing increments to avoid cramped stacks.
16. Shaping Use subtle card edges. Component focus: src/components/profileSettings/EndorsementsPanel.jsx needs consistent 8-12px radii and slender silhouettes so everything feels slim and professional.
17. Shadow, hover, glow and effects Minimal. Component focus: src/components/profileSettings/EndorsementsPanel.jsx must drop neon glows; use subtle 0 8px 16px shadows and tactile hover/focus states only where necessary.
18. Thumbnails Standardize avatar cropping. Component focus: src/components/profileSettings/EndorsementsPanel.jsx should load 3:2 or 1:1 thumbnails via the media pipeline; otherwise hide empty containers gracefully.
19. Images and media & Images and media previews Provide media gallery with consistent aspect ratio. Component focus: src/components/profileSettings/EndorsementsPanel.jsx has to request optimized WebP/AVIF assets, fallback icons, and skeleton loaders for media-heavy blocks.
20. Button styling Provide inline icon buttons for edit. Component focus: src/components/profileSettings/EndorsementsPanel.jsx should align button heights to 40-44px, adopt primary/secondary/tertiary tokens, and support icon-leading CTAs.
21. Interactiveness Add drag-and-drop reorder with accessible controls. Component focus: src/components/profileSettings/EndorsementsPanel.jsx must expose keyboard shortcuts, aria labeling, focus rings, and restful micro-interactions aligned to the new motion spec.
22. Missing Components Add profile completion tracker. Component focus: src/components/profileSettings/EndorsementsPanel.jsx needs to surface any missing states—empty, loading, error—and add quick actions promised in the redesign roadmap.
23. Design Changes Merge view/edit into single progressive experience. Component focus: src/components/profileSettings/EndorsementsPanel.jsx should restructure markup to match the modular IA: hero > context > actions > feed, ensuring content groups breathe.

5.A.1 src/pages/FeedPage.jsx
1. Appraisal. Feed is cluttered with experimental features and placeholder cards. Component focus: src/pages/FeedPage.jsx keeps the feed page container in the bloated Feed & Timeline; rebuild it with streamlined markup, unified spacing tokens, and Figma-sourced hierarchy.
2. Functionality Real-time updates rely on external Meilisearch and worker orchestrator references; needs internalized socket. Component focus: src/pages/FeedPage.jsx must hook into the centralized Feed & Timeline state machine instead of keeping ad-hoc handlers so interactions stay in sync across desktop and mobile.
3. Logic Usefulness Reaction logic redundant; analytics heavy. Component focus: src/pages/FeedPage.jsx should defer business logic to shared hooks/services; keep only view logic so usefulness lines up with backend RBAC and context providers.
4. Redundancies Duplicate tabs for trending/new. Component focus: src/pages/FeedPage.jsx currently duplicates flows across sibling modules; collapse it into the single navigation schema and remove stray shortcuts.
5. Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs Story highlights stub. Component focus: src/pages/FeedPage.jsx still renders placeholders or AI/course/ebook links; strip those routes and ensure only live experiences remain.
6. Duplicate Functions Reaction and analytics repeated across components. Component focus: src/pages/FeedPage.jsx reimplements helper functions locally; shift those into shared utilities to prevent divergence.
7. Improvements need to make Simplify to core feed with composer, posts, reactions, comments. Component focus: src/pages/FeedPage.jsx needs a rebuild following the new blueprint with TypeScript props, design tokens, and RTL support baked in.
8. Styling improvements Adopt clean card with consistent spacing. Component focus: src/pages/FeedPage.jsx should adopt neutral background, 8px radius, and 48px rhythm so the Feed & Timeline feels premium.
9. Efficiency analysis and improvement Use pagination/infinite scroll with caching. Component focus: src/pages/FeedPage.jsx must memoize heavy lists, lazy-load assets, and share data fetching hooks to keep the shell responsive.
10. Strengths to Keep Keep composer quick share. Component focus: src/pages/FeedPage.jsx already communicates the core story; preserve the clarity but align iconography and copy tone with the refreshed brand.
11. Weaknesses to remove Remove AI insights, heavy analytics. Component focus: src/pages/FeedPage.jsx carries legacy gradients, noise, or multi-column chaos; remove them to eliminate the weak points flagged here.
12. Styling and Colour review changes Neutral card backgrounds. Component focus: src/pages/FeedPage.jsx should swap to the navy/sky/slate palette with accent coral, ensuring contrast meets WCAG.
13. Css, orientation, placement and arrangement changes Align to single column with side rails for suggestions. Component focus: src/pages/FeedPage.jsx needs responsive grid/flex layouts with defined breakpoints so spacing is consistent across viewports.
14. Text analysis, text placement, text length, text redundancy and quality of text analysis Ensure post text uses comfortable line length. Component focus: src/pages/FeedPage.jsx must rewrite headings and helper copy to be concise, action-oriented, and free of placeholder jargon.
15. Text Spacing Provide spacing between posts. Component focus: src/pages/FeedPage.jsx should align typography to 1.5 line-height and 8/16px spacing increments to avoid cramped stacks.
16. Shaping Use 12px card radius. Component focus: src/pages/FeedPage.jsx needs consistent 8-12px radii and slender silhouettes so everything feels slim and professional.
17. Shadow, hover, glow and effects Subtle card shadow. Component focus: src/pages/FeedPage.jsx must drop neon glows; use subtle 0 8px 16px shadows and tactile hover/focus states only where necessary.
18. Thumbnails Standardize media preview sizes. Component focus: src/pages/FeedPage.jsx should load 3:2 or 1:1 thumbnails via the media pipeline; otherwise hide empty containers gracefully.
19. Images and media & Images and media previews Provide video thumbnail overlay. Component focus: src/pages/FeedPage.jsx has to request optimized WebP/AVIF assets, fallback icons, and skeleton loaders for media-heavy blocks.
20. Button styling Reaction buttons slim with icons. Component focus: src/pages/FeedPage.jsx should align button heights to 40-44px, adopt primary/secondary/tertiary tokens, and support icon-leading CTAs.
21. Interactiveness Provide accessible keyboard interactions. Component focus: src/pages/FeedPage.jsx must expose keyboard shortcuts, aria labeling, focus rings, and restful micro-interactions aligned to the new motion spec.
22. Missing Components Add pinned announcements. Component focus: src/pages/FeedPage.jsx needs to surface any missing states—empty, loading, error—and add quick actions promised in the redesign roadmap.
23. Design Changes Create modular feed architecture. Component focus: src/pages/FeedPage.jsx should restructure markup to match the modular IA: hero > context > actions > feed, ensuring content groups breathe.
24. Design Duplication Remove duplicate feed card variations. Component focus: src/pages/FeedPage.jsx must consolidate duplicates by reusing the shared UI kit primitives instead of custom wrappers.
25. Design framework Document feed components. Component focus: src/pages/FeedPage.jsx has to import the new design tokens package, consume typography/color/spacing maps, and document any overrides.
26. Mobile App Functionality Mirror feed in Flutter with smooth scroll. Component focus: src/pages/FeedPage.jsx must ensure APIs and sockets feed the Flutter app parity by returning normalized payloads and state events.
27. Mobile App Styling Use same card design. Component focus: src/pages/FeedPage.jsx needs to match Flutter spacing/typography tokens so cross-platform experiences look native yet unified.
28. Change Checklist Tracker Extensive Redo feed API, update UI, integrate new sockets. Component focus: src/pages/FeedPage.jsx requires a tracked checklist—component spec, Figma sign-off, unit tests, Storybook/Chromatic, QA signoff—before release.
29. Full Upgrade Plan & Release Steps  Extensive Stage new feed, run load tests, release. Component focus: src/pages/FeedPage.jsx should ship via phased rollout: behind feature flag, gradual cohort exposure, telemetry review, and final enablement.

1. Appraisal. Projects section overloaded with builder, kanban, timeline features causing complexity. Component focus: src/components/gigs/GigCard.jsx keeps the gig card in the bloated Projects & Gigs; rebuild it with streamlined markup, unified spacing tokens, and Figma-sourced hierarchy.
2. Functionality Auto-match references AI scoring; remove and replace with internal matching rules. Component focus: src/components/gigs/GigCard.jsx must hook into the centralized Projects & Gigs state machine instead of keeping ad-hoc handlers so interactions stay in sync across desktop and mobile.
3. Logic Usefulness Overlapping features with workspace. Component focus: src/components/gigs/GigCard.jsx should defer business logic to shared hooks/services; keep only view logic so usefulness lines up with backend RBAC and context providers.
4. Redundancies Duplicate boards and timelines. Component focus: src/components/gigs/GigCard.jsx currently duplicates flows across sibling modules; collapse it into the single navigation schema and remove stray shortcuts.
5. Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs Auto-match stub. Component focus: src/components/gigs/GigCard.jsx still renders placeholders or AI/course/ebook links; strip those routes and ensure only live experiences remain.
6. Duplicate Functions Task management duplicates workspace. Component focus: src/components/gigs/GigCard.jsx reimplements helper functions locally; shift those into shared utilities to prevent divergence.
7. Improvements need to make Focus on core project brief, candidate submissions, timeline overview. Component focus: src/components/gigs/GigCard.jsx needs a rebuild following the new blueprint with TypeScript props, design tokens, and RTL support baked in.
8. Styling improvements Use clean cards. Component focus: src/components/gigs/GigCard.jsx should adopt neutral background, 8px radius, and 48px rhythm so the Projects & Gigs feels premium.
9. Efficiency analysis and improvement Simplify data fetch, remove heavy state management. Component focus: src/components/gigs/GigCard.jsx must memoize heavy lists, lazy-load assets, and share data fetching hooks to keep the shell responsive.
10. Strengths to Keep Keep gig builder but simplify fields. Component focus: src/components/gigs/GigCard.jsx already communicates the core story; preserve the clarity but align iconography and copy tone with the refreshed brand.
11. Weaknesses to remove Remove AI auto-match, redundant kanban. Component focus: src/components/gigs/GigCard.jsx carries legacy gradients, noise, or multi-column chaos; remove them to eliminate the weak points flagged here.
12. Styling and Colour review changes Use consistent colors. Component focus: src/components/gigs/GigCard.jsx should swap to the navy/sky/slate palette with accent coral, ensuring contrast meets WCAG.
13. Css, orientation, placement and arrangement changes Align to 2-column layout. Component focus: src/components/gigs/GigCard.jsx needs responsive grid/flex layouts with defined breakpoints so spacing is consistent across viewports.
14. Text analysis, text placement, text length, text redundancy and quality of text analysis Provide crisp descriptions. Component focus: src/components/gigs/GigCard.jsx must rewrite headings and helper copy to be concise, action-oriented, and free of placeholder jargon.
