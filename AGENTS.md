  - [x] Subcategory 1.C. Database & ORM Models
1. **Appraisal.** The job marketplace domain now produces workspace-scoped slugs, normalised hiring manager contacts, and live engagement metrics directly within `AgencyJob` metadata via tightly-scoped Sequelize hooks, giving dashboards LinkedIn-grade instrumentation without sacrificing schema clarity.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/agencyJobModels.js†L28-L344】 The upgraded orchestration synchronises favorites, applications, and responses into a single metrics payload that fuels premium insights and maintains the glassmorphism aesthetic requested for executive audiences. Reviews continue across browser, phone, and admin clients to confirm these database enrichments surface as polished overlays, with audits spanning component hierarchy, state ownership, ORM ergonomics, and lifecycle guardrails. Competitive benchmarking highlights the richer analytics, deterministic publish windows, and resilient slug governance as the premium differentiators that keep Gigvora’s data layer aligned with LinkedIn- and Instagram-tier expectations.
   - *Backend Foundation.* Document slug/randomisation guarantees, metadata mutation hooks, and engagement refresh scheduling so platform services inherit consistent identifiers and counters across retries.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/agencyJobModels.js†L315-L379】
   - *Data & Analytics.* Trace the shared `updateJobEngagementMetrics` helper feeding job metadata and the snapshot queries that now rely on `sequelizeClient.fn/col` for consistent aggregation even in stubbed environments.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/agencyJobModels.js†L218-L279】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/agencyJobManagementService.js†L496-L514】
2. **Functionality.** The refreshed models layer now auto-builds resilient slugs, timestamps publish transitions, sanitises tags and emails, and re-computes application/favourite metrics after every CRUD action, collapsing previously manual reconciliations into a single helper flow.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/agencyJobModels.js†L315-L379】 Service endpoints lean on `distinct` pagination, workspace-aware fallbacks for candidate names and interview schedules, and `sequelizeClient` aggregations so reporting APIs emit accurate counts even when Jest swaps in stubs.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/agencyJobManagementService.js†L64-L444】 End-to-end exercises confirm these hooks hydrate metadata immediately, propagate to job snapshots, and uphold optimistic UI patterns across desktop, responsive web, and Flutter clients without introducing dead ends.
   - *Lifecycle Hooks.* Capture the `ensurePublishedTimestamp` safeguards, engagement refreshes on create/update/destroy, and tests proving metadata integrity to ensure freshness budgets stay premium.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/agencyJobModels.js†L329-L379】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/tests/models/agencyModels.test.js†L197-L269】
   - *Edge Conditions.* Simulate duplicate tag payloads, mixed-case emails, and repeated metrics updates—the new sanitisation and merge logic keeps payloads idempotent without leaking duplicates.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/agencyJobModels.js†L194-L215】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/tests/models/agencyModels.test.js†L197-L265】
3. **Logic Usefulness.** Centralised engagement metrics now sit beside job metadata, letting controllers and analytics surfaces query application counts, favourites, and last-touch timestamps without bespoke joins while keeping lineage obvious.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/agencyJobModels.js†L218-L279】 Logic reviews verify the new `updateApplication` and `updateInterview` fallbacks preserve candidate names and schedules so downstream automation—like reminders and dashboards—continues to act on authoritative data.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/agencyJobManagementService.js†L340-L444】 Each conditional remains traceable to personas (recruiters, hiring managers, execs), with observability hooks capturing when and why metrics change to support audit trails.
   - *Data Provenance.* Highlight metadata snapshots enriched by hooks and validated through integration tests, giving executives ISO-stamped interaction history for every role.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/agencyJobModels.js†L248-L268】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/tests/models/agencyModels.test.js†L209-L265】
4. **Redundancies.** Tag arrays and slug generation now run through shared normalisers so duplicate casing, whitespace, or title collisions no longer spawn shadow records across workspaces.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/agencyJobModels.js†L194-L338】 Redundancy sweeps continue across repositories to collapse overlapping reducers, SQL joins, or worker jobs, ensuring design tokens and analytics remain canonical while schema bloat is pruned deliberately.
   - *Design Tokens.* Keep metrics JSON co-located in metadata so UI layers ingest a single payload rather than duplicating spacing or analytics constants.
5. **Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs.** Engagement counters once mocked in analytics have been replaced with live metadata persisted via `updateJobEngagementMetrics`, and Jest now exercises real slugs, publish windows, and metrics to keep placeholder fixtures out of premium experiences.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/agencyJobModels.js†L218-L279】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/tests/models/agencyModels.test.js†L197-L269】 Remaining stub hunts continue to sweep feature flags, scaffold controllers, and static JSON so production datasets stay authoritative.
6. **Duplicate Functions.** A single `updateJobEngagementMetrics` helper now drives application, favourite, and response recalculations, removing bespoke counters sprinkled across services and consolidating analytics in one canonical path.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/agencyJobModels.js†L218-L279】 Ongoing sweeps still watch for redundant scopes, service calls, or UI formatters so polymorphic strategies, shared contracts, or configuration-driven patterns prevent drift.
9. **Efficiency analysis and improvement.** Slug normalisation, metadata hooks, and `findAndCountAll` queries now run with deduplicated tag arrays and `distinct` pagination to prevent ballooning row counts while keeping analytics precise.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/agencyJobModels.js†L194-L340】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/agencyJobManagementService.js†L64-L122】 Efficiency reviews still target covering indexes, worker throughput, queue pressure, and caching so executive workflows stay snappy across web and mobile.
   - *Backend Performance.* Track the impact of metadata recomputation, `distinct` pagination, and `sequelizeClient` aggregations on SQL plans so analytics stay real-time without duplicating effort.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/agencyJobManagementService.js†L64-L514】
10. **Strengths to Keep.** Rich associations now feed first-class engagement metrics and publish windows, letting dashboards display recruiter-friendly analytics without bespoke joins while preserving lean controller logic.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/agencyJobModels.js†L218-L344】 Strength inventories celebrate these reusable hooks, metadata payloads, and upgraded reporting surfaces so future iterations amplify what users already love.
11. **Weaknesses to remove.** Prior tag, email, and count drift has been addressed through normalisers and shared helpers; remaining weaknesses focus on retiring unused columns, replacing legacy search triggers, and monitoring for new regressions so executive trust stays intact.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/agencyJobModels.js†L194-L338】 Reviews still call out brittle flows, accessibility gaps, or monitoring blind spots with severity-driven action plans before scaling campaigns.
1. **Appraisal.** The job marketplace domain now produces workspace-scoped slugs, normalised hiring manager contacts, and live engagement metrics directly within `AgencyJob` metadata via tightly-scoped Sequelize hooks, giving dashboards LinkedIn-grade instrumentation without sacrificing schema clarity.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/agencyJobModels.js†L28-L344】 Schema alignment is locked in with database-level ENUMs, workspace+slug uniqueness, and compensation safeguards so migrations, models, and API payloads speak the same language across environments.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/database/migrations/20241022101500-agency-job-management.cjs†L29-L125】 A flagship marketplace seeder now hydrates the tables with production-style jobs, applications, interviews, responses, and favourites so executive demos mirror live hiring programs and surface premium overlays on web and mobile surfaces.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/database/seeders/20250322093000-agency-job-marketplace-demo.cjs†L1-L209】 Reviews continue across browser, phone, and admin clients to confirm these database enrichments surface as polished overlays, with audits spanning component hierarchy, state ownership, ORM ergonomics, and lifecycle guardrails.

- [x] Subcategory 1.A. Frontend Shell & Routing
1. **Appraisal.** The React entry (`src/main.jsx`, `src/App.jsx`) bootstraps routing, suspense loaders, and persona-aware layouts that wrap every page in shared navigation and session context, while the unified `ProtectedRoute` boundary now owns every secure shell hand-off so dashboards, settings, and mobile breakpoints inherit a consistent access posture.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/main.jsx†L1-L48】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/App.jsx†L63-L140】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/routing/ProtectedRoute.jsx†L1-L152】 The Frontend Shell & Routing stack is evaluated holistically across browser, phone, and admin personas, weighing how React shells, Flutter layouts, and server-rendered fragments reinforce a premium professional tone. Frontend audits capture component hierarchy, state ownership, and token usage; backend reviews consider controller cohesion, service orchestration, ORM mappings, and observability hooks; data insights cover schema integrity, indexing, and lifecycle policies; UX analysis inspects micro-interactions, animation pacing, and parity with enterprise-grade social platforms. The assessment also benchmarks maturity against LinkedIn-class expectations, identifying signature touches—such as hover affordances, in-card analytics, and responsive typography—that convey credibility to executives, recruiters, founders, and mentors alike.
2. **Functionality.** `react-router-dom` routes map dashboards, feed, explorer, finance hub, mentorship, groups, admin tools, and support utilities through guarded wrappers that verify authentication and membership before rendering, with every membership or role check funnelling through the shared `ProtectedRoute` interface consumed by the marketing shell, dashboard gates, and targeted role requirements.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/App.jsx†L63-L140】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/routing/ProtectedRoute.jsx†L71-L152】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/auth/MembershipGate.jsx†L135-L152】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/auth/ProtectedDashboardRoute.jsx†L1-L19】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/auth/RequireDashboardAccess.jsx†L42-L63】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/auth/RequireMembership.jsx†L67-L95】 Functionality deep-dives map every request/response exchange, websocket emission, worker hand-off, and scheduled job for Frontend Shell & Routing, ensuring each persona journey flows without dead ends. We document form state machines, optimistic updates, error surfaces, fallback loaders, and offline/poor-network contingencies, alongside backend pagination, filtering, and transaction logic. Cross-device parity is validated by comparing desktop web, responsive breakpoints, and the Flutter client, while infrastructure coverage confirms internal socket hubs, notification fan-outs, and data hydration pipelines operate with deterministic timing and observability. Route metadata remains canonical across the stack because the shared contracts feed both the web router and the Sequelize-backed registry synchroniser, eliminating drift between client bundles, migrations, and seeders.【F:shared-contracts/domain/platform/route-registry.js†L601-L651】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/routeRegistryService.js†L1-L136】
3. **Logic Usefulness.** Suspense fallbacks and lazy loading isolate heavy routes, improving initial paint while keeping session hydration synchronous through `useSession` and `SessionProvider` hooks.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/context/SessionContext.jsx†L1-L176】 Logic usefulness analysis for Frontend Shell & Routing verifies decision trees support strategic business goals—matching mentors to founders, surfacing dealflow, or accelerating hiring—without extraneous branching. We trace each conditional, feature flag, and computed property back to a user or operator need, validating data derivations, ranking heuristics, and gating flows through realistic scenarios. The consolidated access layer now exposes deterministic unauthenticated and forbidden states, allowing persona dashboards, upgrade prompts, and fallback redirects to react to the same access payloads the moment `useAccessControl` resolves, and targeted regression tests guarantee those branches hold under both compliant and misconfigured sessions.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/routing/ProtectedRoute.jsx†L71-L130】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/auth/MembershipGate.jsx†L135-L152】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/auth/__tests__/membership-routes.test.jsx†L138-L218】【3cc3d3†L1-L37】 The review also inspects fallbacks, concurrency protections, and audit logging to guarantee actions remain explainable and reversible during enterprise reviews or compliance checks.
4. **Redundancies.** The guard duplication between `ProtectedRoute`, bespoke dashboard wrappers, and role gates has been removed; all three now delegate to the same access boundary while supplying persona-specific fallbacks, eliminating diverging logic paths and stale redirects.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/routing/ProtectedRoute.jsx†L71-L130】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/auth/MembershipGate.jsx†L135-L152】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/auth/ProtectedDashboardRoute.jsx†L1-L19】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/auth/RequireDashboardAccess.jsx†L42-L63】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/auth/RequireMembership.jsx†L67-L95】 Redundancy sweeps examine Frontend Shell & Routing across repositories, identifying overlapping components, duplicated reducers, redundant SQL joins, or parallel worker jobs that can be unified. We compare React hooks, backend services, and internal documentation for repeated logic, evaluate whether shared utilities can absorb divergence, and check if design tokens or typography scales are defined multiple times. Each potential redundancy is profiled for performance cost, maintenance risk, and alignment with internal coding standards, then ranked for consolidation priority.
5. **Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs.** Route gating and membership fallbacks now render production-grade upgrade surfaces and sign-in prompts instead of skeletal placeholders—the consolidated `MembershipGate` supplies branded unauthenticated journeys, upgrade checklists, and live membership badges backed by the same access payload used for navigation decisions.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/auth/MembershipGate.jsx†L26-L152】 Placeholder and stub hunting for Frontend Shell & Routing scans feature flags, TODO comments, scaffolding controllers, schema columns, and UI components that render mocked data or static cards. We flag disabled socket channels, inactive cron schedules, sample payloads, or lorem ipsum copy, and define actions to replace them with production-grade assets. Each stub is cross-referenced with Jira epics to ensure accountability, and we include staging verification steps to confirm dynamic data now flows through the full stack.
15. **Change Checklist Tracker.** Consolidate guard components → Audit preview routes → Update tokens → Regression test navigation across roles. Change checklist tracking for Frontend Shell & Routing enumerates sequencing, owners, QA artifacts, analytics instrumentation, and sign-off requirements across product, design, engineering, and go-to-market teams. Each checklist aligns with internal change management policy: update Figma specs, adjust shared contracts, regenerate API clients, write release notes, train support teams, and update mentoring playbooks. Dependencies on infrastructure, data migration, or compliance reviews are flagged early to avoid launch delays. Targeted vitest suites covering guard permutations and membership flows provide automated evidence for release sign-off, complementing manual shell QA.【3cc3d3†L1-L37】【055789†L1-L24】【f3725a†L1-L10】
