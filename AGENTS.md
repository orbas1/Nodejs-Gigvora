Hyper-Detail Addendum

1.A.1 src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx — Expanded Component Blueprint
1. Appraisal. src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx sits on legacy scaffolding that tangles presentation and business concerns; capture an exhaustive inventory of props, context, and downstream consumers before the redesign begins so no path is missed.
2. Functionality. Audit every event handler inside src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx and document success, failure, and loading states; wire them to integration tests that simulate desktop, tablet, and mobile behaviours.
3. Logic Usefulness. Trace the logic stack for src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx from data request to render and challenge each conditional; if the logic does not deliver measurable user value or analytics insight, move it to backlog or delete it.
4. Redundancies. Compare src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx with sibling modules to remove duplicated utilities, nested wrappers, or styling fragments; publish a diff in the component registry before merging changes.
5. Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs. Replace any placeholder links, TODO blocks, or stub async functions in src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx with production-ready flows or delete them outright so the experience is never half-finished.
6. Duplicate Functions. Merge repeated helper functions in src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx into shared hooks and memoized selectors; annotate the removal in changelog entries so other squads can update imports.
7. Improvements need to make. Build a Figma-aligned implementation brief for src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx that includes acceptance criteria, telemetry goals, accessibility checklists, and rollout guardrails.
8. Styling improvements. Translate the high-fidelity tokens to src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx with explicit specs for spacing, typography, radii, and shadows; reject any variance greater than 1px or 1dp when doing visual QA.
9. Efficiency analysis and improvement. Profile src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx with React Profiler (or relevant tooling) to eliminate wasted renders, heavy bundles, and blocking network waterfalls; capture before-and-after metrics.
10. Strengths to Keep. Catalog the behaviours in src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx that users rely on—keyboard shortcuts, progressive disclosure, crisp copy—and lock them into regression tests so they are preserved during overhaul.
11. Weaknesses to remove. Identify every confusing micro-interaction, misaligned icon, or inconsistent layout within src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx and remove them during the redesign sprint; document the removals for stakeholder sign-off.
12. Styling and Colour review changes. Apply the approved navy-slate base palette and coral accents to src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx, validate contrast ratios, and add dark-mode tokens to the design tokens library.
13. Css, orientation, placement and arrangement changes. Recompose src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx using modern layout primitives (flex/grid/auto layout) with defined breakpoints for desktop, tablet, and mobile to keep orientation predictable.
14. Text analysis, text placement, text length, text redundancy and quality of text analysis. Rewrite every string rendered by src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx so it is sharp, user-focused, and internationalization-ready; capture length budgets in the content guide.
15. Text Spacing. Implement typographic rhythm in src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx with 4/8/12px increments, consistent line-heights, and purposeful white space so dense data still breathes.
16. Shaping. Align corners, chips, and avatar cuts in src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx to the shared 8/12/16 radius matrix; include shape tokens for states like pressed or focused.
17. Shadow, hover, glow and effects. Limit src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx to brand-sanctioned elevations and transitions; codify hover, focus, and pressed states with measurable durations and easing curves.
18. Thumbnails. Audit any media or thumbnail surfaces inside src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx; enforce standardized aspect ratios, fallback illustrations, and lazy-loading placeholders.
19. Images and media & Images and media previews. Route all media requests in src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx through the optimized CDN pipeline with responsive sourcesets, skeleton states, and upload progress indicators.
20. Button styling. Enforce the slim 40-44px high button variants in src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx, with icon-leading, text-only, and destructive options backed by accessible focus outlines.
21. Interactiveness. Instrument src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx with keyboard navigation, screen-reader announcements, pointer and touch gestures, and micro-animations aligned to Material motion values.
22. Missing Components. Confirm whether src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx requires supporting elements like tooltips, empty states, or inline coaching; design and implement them if absent so flows never dead-end.
23. Design Changes. Map src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx to the refined information architecture, ensuring entry points, breadcrumbs, and contextual actions reflect the simplified mental model.
24. Design Duplication. Register src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx in the design system catalogue with a canonical spec so teams stop forking the UI for similar needs.
25. Design framework. Publish component docs for src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx covering props, data contracts, accessibility, theming, QA steps, and code samples inside Storybook/Chromatic.
26. Mobile App Functionality. Mirror src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx's functionality in Flutter or native modules by exporting schema types, event contracts, and UI mocks to the mobile squad.
27. Mobile App Styling. Deliver color, typography, and spacing tokens derived from src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx to the mobile theming pipeline so parity is preserved across devices.
28. Change Checklist Tracker Extensive. Track src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx's rebuild in the program board with tasks for design sign-off, unit tests, integration tests, localization, analytics, release notes, and playbook updates.
29. Full Upgrade Plan & Release Steps  Extensive. Run src/components/navigation/AppTopBar.jsx through feature-flagged rollout: ship to internal alpha, capture metrics, fix defects, graduate to beta cohorts, prepare comms, then launch globally.

1.A.7 src/components/navigation/MobileMegaMenu.jsx — Expanded Component Blueprint
1. Appraisal. src/components/navigation/MobileMegaMenu.jsx sits on legacy scaffolding that tangles presentation and business concerns; capture an exhaustive inventory of props, context, and downstream consumers before the redesign begins so no path is missed.
2. Functionality. Audit every event handler inside src/components/navigation/MobileMegaMenu.jsx and document success, failure, and loading states; wire them to integration tests that simulate desktop, tablet, and mobile behaviours.
3. Logic Usefulness. Trace the logic stack for src/components/navigation/MobileMegaMenu.jsx from data request to render and challenge each conditional; if the logic does not deliver measurable user value or analytics insight, move it to backlog or delete it.
4. Redundancies. Compare src/components/navigation/MobileMegaMenu.jsx with sibling modules to remove duplicated utilities, nested wrappers, or styling fragments; publish a diff in the component registry before merging changes.
5. Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs. Replace any placeholder links, TODO blocks, or stub async functions in src/components/navigation/MobileMegaMenu.jsx with production-ready flows or delete them outright so the experience is never half-finished.
6. Duplicate Functions. Merge repeated helper functions in src/components/navigation/MobileMegaMenu.jsx into shared hooks and memoized selectors; annotate the removal in changelog entries so other squads can update imports.
7. Improvements need to make. Build a Figma-aligned implementation brief for src/components/navigation/MobileMegaMenu.jsx that includes acceptance criteria, telemetry goals, accessibility checklists, and rollout guardrails.
8. Styling improvements. Translate the high-fidelity tokens to src/components/navigation/MobileMegaMenu.jsx with explicit specs for spacing, typography, radii, and shadows; reject any variance greater than 1px or 1dp when doing visual QA.
9. Efficiency analysis and improvement. Profile src/components/navigation/MobileMegaMenu.jsx with React Profiler (or relevant tooling) to eliminate wasted renders, heavy bundles, and blocking network waterfalls; capture before-and-after metrics.
10. Strengths to Keep. Catalog the behaviours in src/components/navigation/MobileMegaMenu.jsx that users rely on—keyboard shortcuts, progressive disclosure, crisp copy—and lock them into regression tests so they are preserved during overhaul.
11. Weaknesses to remove. Identify every confusing micro-interaction, misaligned icon, or inconsistent layout within src/components/navigation/MobileMegaMenu.jsx and remove them during the redesign sprint; document the removals for stakeholder sign-off.
12. Styling and Colour review changes. Apply the approved navy-slate base palette and coral accents to src/components/navigation/MobileMegaMenu.jsx, validate contrast ratios, and add dark-mode tokens to the design tokens library.
13. Css, orientation, placement and arrangement changes. Recompose src/components/navigation/MobileMegaMenu.jsx using modern layout primitives (flex/grid/auto layout) with defined breakpoints for desktop, tablet, and mobile to keep orientation predictable.

1.C.3 src/layouts/SiteLayout.jsx — Expanded Component Blueprint
1. Appraisal. src/layouts/SiteLayout.jsx sits on legacy scaffolding that tangles presentation and business concerns; capture an exhaustive inventory of props, context, and downstream consumers before the redesign begins so no path is missed.
2. Functionality. Audit every event handler inside src/layouts/SiteLayout.jsx and document success, failure, and loading states; wire them to integration tests that simulate desktop, tablet, and mobile behaviours.
3. Logic Usefulness. Trace the logic stack for src/layouts/SiteLayout.jsx from data request to render and challenge each conditional; if the logic does not deliver measurable user value or analytics insight, move it to backlog or delete it.
4. Redundancies. Compare src/layouts/SiteLayout.jsx with sibling modules to remove duplicated utilities, nested wrappers, or styling fragments; publish a diff in the component registry before merging changes.
5. Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs. Replace any placeholder links, TODO blocks, or stub async functions in src/layouts/SiteLayout.jsx with production-ready flows or delete them outright so the experience is never half-finished.
6. Duplicate Functions. Merge repeated helper functions in src/layouts/SiteLayout.jsx into shared hooks and memoized selectors; annotate the removal in changelog entries so other squads can update imports.
7. Improvements need to make. Build a Figma-aligned implementation brief for src/layouts/SiteLayout.jsx that includes acceptance criteria, telemetry goals, accessibility checklists, and rollout guardrails.
8. Styling improvements. Translate the high-fidelity tokens to src/layouts/SiteLayout.jsx with explicit specs for spacing, typography, radii, and shadows; reject any variance greater than 1px or 1dp when doing visual QA.
9. Efficiency analysis and improvement. Profile src/layouts/SiteLayout.jsx with React Profiler (or relevant tooling) to eliminate wasted renders, heavy bundles, and blocking network waterfalls; capture before-and-after metrics.
10. Strengths to Keep. Catalog the behaviours in src/layouts/SiteLayout.jsx that users rely on—keyboard shortcuts, progressive disclosure, crisp copy—and lock them into regression tests so they are preserved during overhaul.
11. Weaknesses to remove. Identify every confusing micro-interaction, misaligned icon, or inconsistent layout within src/layouts/SiteLayout.jsx and remove them during the redesign sprint; document the removals for stakeholder sign-off.
12. Styling and Colour review changes. Apply the approved navy-slate base palette and coral accents to src/layouts/SiteLayout.jsx, validate contrast ratios, and add dark-mode tokens to the design tokens library.
13. Css, orientation, placement and arrangement changes. Recompose src/layouts/SiteLayout.jsx using modern layout primitives (flex/grid/auto layout) with defined breakpoints for desktop, tablet, and mobile to keep orientation predictable.
14. Text analysis, text placement, text length, text redundancy and quality of text analysis. Rewrite every string rendered by src/layouts/SiteLayout.jsx so it is sharp, user-focused, and internationalization-ready; capture length budgets in the content guide.
15. Text Spacing. Implement typographic rhythm in src/layouts/SiteLayout.jsx with 4/8/12px increments, consistent line-heights, and purposeful white space so dense data still breathes.
16. Shaping. Align corners, chips, and avatar cuts in src/layouts/SiteLayout.jsx to the shared 8/12/16 radius matrix; include shape tokens for states like pressed or focused.
17. Shadow, hover, glow and effects. Limit src/layouts/SiteLayout.jsx to brand-sanctioned elevations and transitions; codify hover, focus, and pressed states with measurable durations and easing curves.
18. Thumbnails. Audit any media or thumbnail surfaces inside src/layouts/SiteLayout.jsx; enforce standardized aspect ratios, fallback illustrations, and lazy-loading placeholders.
19. Images and media & Images and media previews. Route all media requests in src/layouts/SiteLayout.jsx through the optimized CDN pipeline with responsive sourcesets, skeleton states, and upload progress indicators.
20. Button styling. Enforce the slim 40-44px high button variants in src/layouts/SiteLayout.jsx, with icon-leading, text-only, and destructive options backed by accessible focus outlines.
21. Interactiveness. Instrument src/layouts/SiteLayout.jsx with keyboard navigation, screen-reader announcements, pointer and touch gestures, and micro-animations aligned to Material motion values.
22. Missing Components. Confirm whether src/layouts/SiteLayout.jsx requires supporting elements like tooltips, empty states, or inline coaching; design and implement them if absent so flows never dead-end.

1.D.1 src/components/toast/ToastHub.jsx — Expanded Component Blueprint
1. Appraisal. src/components/toast/ToastHub.jsx sits on legacy scaffolding that tangles presentation and business concerns; capture an exhaustive inventory of props, context, and downstream consumers before the redesign begins so no path is missed.
2. Functionality. Audit every event handler inside src/components/toast/ToastHub.jsx and document success, failure, and loading states; wire them to integration tests that simulate desktop, tablet, and mobile behaviours.
3. Logic Usefulness. Trace the logic stack for src/components/toast/ToastHub.jsx from data request to render and challenge each conditional; if the logic does not deliver measurable user value or analytics insight, move it to backlog or delete it.
4. Redundancies. Compare src/components/toast/ToastHub.jsx with sibling modules to remove duplicated utilities, nested wrappers, or styling fragments; publish a diff in the component registry before merging changes.
5. Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs. Replace any placeholder links, TODO blocks, or stub async functions in src/components/toast/ToastHub.jsx with production-ready flows or delete them outright so the experience is never half-finished.
6. Duplicate Functions. Merge repeated helper functions in src/components/toast/ToastHub.jsx into shared hooks and memoized selectors; annotate the removal in changelog entries so other squads can update imports.

2.A.2 src/pages/HomePage.jsx — Expanded Component Blueprint
1. Appraisal. src/pages/HomePage.jsx sits on legacy scaffolding that tangles presentation and business concerns; capture an exhaustive inventory of props, context, and downstream consumers before the redesign begins so no path is missed.
2. Functionality. Audit every event handler inside src/pages/HomePage.jsx and document success, failure, and loading states; wire them to integration tests that simulate desktop, tablet, and mobile behaviours.
3. Logic Usefulness. Trace the logic stack for src/pages/HomePage.jsx from data request to render and challenge each conditional; if the logic does not deliver measurable user value or analytics insight, move it to backlog or delete it.
4. Redundancies. Compare src/pages/HomePage.jsx with sibling modules to remove duplicated utilities, nested wrappers, or styling fragments; publish a diff in the component registry before merging changes.
5. Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs. Replace any placeholder links, TODO blocks, or stub async functions in src/pages/HomePage.jsx with production-ready flows or delete them outright so the experience is never half-finished.
6. Duplicate Functions. Merge repeated helper functions in src/pages/HomePage.jsx into shared hooks and memoized selectors; annotate the removal in changelog entries so other squads can update imports.
7. Improvements need to make. Build a Figma-aligned implementation brief for src/pages/HomePage.jsx that includes acceptance criteria, telemetry goals, accessibility checklists, and rollout guardrails.
8. Styling improvements. Translate the high-fidelity tokens to src/pages/HomePage.jsx with explicit specs for spacing, typography, radii, and shadows; reject any variance greater than 1px or 1dp when doing visual QA.
9. Efficiency analysis and improvement. Profile src/pages/HomePage.jsx with React Profiler (or relevant tooling) to eliminate wasted renders, heavy bundles, and blocking network waterfalls; capture before-and-after metrics.
10. Strengths to Keep. Catalog the behaviours in src/pages/HomePage.jsx that users rely on—keyboard shortcuts, progressive disclosure, crisp copy—and lock them into regression tests so they are preserved during overhaul.
11. Weaknesses to remove. Identify every confusing micro-interaction, misaligned icon, or inconsistent layout within src/pages/HomePage.jsx and remove them during the redesign sprint; document the removals for stakeholder sign-off.
12. Styling and Colour review changes. Apply the approved navy-slate base palette and coral accents to src/pages/HomePage.jsx, validate contrast ratios, and add dark-mode tokens to the design tokens library.
13. Css, orientation, placement and arrangement changes. Recompose src/pages/HomePage.jsx using modern layout primitives (flex/grid/auto layout) with defined breakpoints for desktop, tablet, and mobile to keep orientation predictable.
14. Text analysis, text placement, text length, text redundancy and quality of text analysis. Rewrite every string rendered by src/pages/HomePage.jsx so it is sharp, user-focused, and internationalization-ready; capture length budgets in the content guide.
15. Text Spacing. Implement typographic rhythm in src/pages/HomePage.jsx with 4/8/12px increments, consistent line-heights, and purposeful white space so dense data still breathes.
16. Shaping. Align corners, chips, and avatar cuts in src/pages/HomePage.jsx to the shared 8/12/16 radius matrix; include shape tokens for states like pressed or focused.
17. Shadow, hover, glow and effects. Limit src/pages/HomePage.jsx to brand-sanctioned elevations and transitions; codify hover, focus, and pressed states with measurable durations and easing curves.
18. Thumbnails. Audit any media or thumbnail surfaces inside src/pages/HomePage.jsx; enforce standardized aspect ratios, fallback illustrations, and lazy-loading placeholders.
19. Images and media & Images and media previews. Route all media requests in src/pages/HomePage.jsx through the optimized CDN pipeline with responsive sourcesets, skeleton states, and upload progress indicators.
20. Button styling. Enforce the slim 40-44px high button variants in src/pages/HomePage.jsx, with icon-leading, text-only, and destructive options backed by accessible focus outlines.
21. Interactiveness. Instrument src/pages/HomePage.jsx with keyboard navigation, screen-reader announcements, pointer and touch gestures, and micro-animations aligned to Material motion values.
22. Missing Components. Confirm whether src/pages/HomePage.jsx requires supporting elements like tooltips, empty states, or inline coaching; design and implement them if absent so flows never dead-end.
23. Design Changes. Map src/pages/HomePage.jsx to the refined information architecture, ensuring entry points, breadcrumbs, and contextual actions reflect the simplified mental model.
24. Design Duplication. Register src/pages/HomePage.jsx in the design system catalogue with a canonical spec so teams stop forking the UI for similar needs.
25. Design framework. Publish component docs for src/pages/HomePage.jsx covering props, data contracts, accessibility, theming, QA steps, and code samples inside Storybook/Chromatic.
26. Mobile App Functionality. Mirror src/pages/HomePage.jsx's functionality in Flutter or native modules by exporting schema types, event contracts, and UI mocks to the mobile squad.

2.A.8 src/components/marketing/LogomarkWall.jsx — Expanded Component Blueprint
1. Appraisal. src/components/marketing/LogomarkWall.jsx sits on legacy scaffolding that tangles presentation and business concerns; capture an exhaustive inventory of props, context, and downstream consumers before the redesign begins so no path is missed.
2. Functionality. Audit every event handler inside src/components/marketing/LogomarkWall.jsx and document success, failure, and loading states; wire them to integration tests that simulate desktop, tablet, and mobile behaviours.
3. Logic Usefulness. Trace the logic stack for src/components/marketing/LogomarkWall.jsx from data request to render and challenge each conditional; if the logic does not deliver measurable user value or analytics insight, move it to backlog or delete it.
4. Redundancies. Compare src/components/marketing/LogomarkWall.jsx with sibling modules to remove duplicated utilities, nested wrappers, or styling fragments; publish a diff in the component registry before merging changes.
5. Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs. Replace any placeholder links, TODO blocks, or stub async functions in src/components/marketing/LogomarkWall.jsx with production-ready flows or delete them outright so the experience is never half-finished.
6. Duplicate Functions. Merge repeated helper functions in src/components/marketing/LogomarkWall.jsx into shared hooks and memoized selectors; annotate the removal in changelog entries so other squads can update imports.
7. Improvements need to make. Build a Figma-aligned implementation brief for src/components/marketing/LogomarkWall.jsx that includes acceptance criteria, telemetry goals, accessibility checklists, and rollout guardrails.
8. Styling improvements. Translate the high-fidelity tokens to src/components/marketing/LogomarkWall.jsx with explicit specs for spacing, typography, radii, and shadows; reject any variance greater than 1px or 1dp when doing visual QA.
9. Efficiency analysis and improvement. Profile src/components/marketing/LogomarkWall.jsx with React Profiler (or relevant tooling) to eliminate wasted renders, heavy bundles, and blocking network waterfalls; capture before-and-after metrics.
10. Strengths to Keep. Catalog the behaviours in src/components/marketing/LogomarkWall.jsx that users rely on—keyboard shortcuts, progressive disclosure, crisp copy—and lock them into regression tests so they are preserved during overhaul.
11. Weaknesses to remove. Identify every confusing micro-interaction, misaligned icon, or inconsistent layout within src/components/marketing/LogomarkWall.jsx and remove them during the redesign sprint; document the removals for stakeholder sign-off.
12. Styling and Colour review changes. Apply the approved navy-slate base palette and coral accents to src/components/marketing/LogomarkWall.jsx, validate contrast ratios, and add dark-mode tokens to the design tokens library.
13. Css, orientation, placement and arrangement changes. Recompose src/components/marketing/LogomarkWall.jsx using modern layout primitives (flex/grid/auto layout) with defined breakpoints for desktop, tablet, and mobile to keep orientation predictable.

3. Logic Usefulness. Trace the logic stack for src/pages/TrustCenter.jsx from data request to render and challenge each conditional; if the logic does not deliver measurable user value or analytics insight, move it to backlog or delete it.
4. Redundancies. Compare src/pages/TrustCenter.jsx with sibling modules to remove duplicated utilities, nested wrappers, or styling fragments; publish a diff in the component registry before merging changes.
5. Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs. Replace any placeholder links, TODO blocks, or stub async functions in src/pages/TrustCenter.jsx with production-ready flows or delete them outright so the experience is never half-finished.
6. Duplicate Functions. Merge repeated helper functions in src/pages/TrustCenter.jsx into shared hooks and memoized selectors; annotate the removal in changelog entries so other squads can update imports.
7. Improvements need to make. Build a Figma-aligned implementation brief for src/pages/TrustCenter.jsx that includes acceptance criteria, telemetry goals, accessibility checklists, and rollout guardrails.
8. Styling improvements. Translate the high-fidelity tokens to src/pages/TrustCenter.jsx with explicit specs for spacing, typography, radii, and shadows; reject any variance greater than 1px or 1dp when doing visual QA.
9. Efficiency analysis and improvement. Profile src/pages/TrustCenter.jsx with React Profiler (or relevant tooling) to eliminate wasted renders, heavy bundles, and blocking network waterfalls; capture before-and-after metrics.
10. Strengths to Keep. Catalog the behaviours in src/pages/TrustCenter.jsx that users rely on—keyboard shortcuts, progressive disclosure, crisp copy—and lock them into regression tests so they are preserved during overhaul.
11. Weaknesses to remove. Identify every confusing micro-interaction, misaligned icon, or inconsistent layout within src/pages/TrustCenter.jsx and remove them during the redesign sprint; document the removals for stakeholder sign-off.
12. Styling and Colour review changes. Apply the approved navy-slate base palette and coral accents to src/pages/TrustCenter.jsx, validate contrast ratios, and add dark-mode tokens to the design tokens library.
13. Css, orientation, placement and arrangement changes. Recompose src/pages/TrustCenter.jsx using modern layout primitives (flex/grid/auto layout) with defined breakpoints for desktop, tablet, and mobile to keep orientation predictable.
14. Text analysis, text placement, text length, text redundancy and quality of text analysis. Rewrite every string rendered by src/pages/TrustCenter.jsx so it is sharp, user-focused, and internationalization-ready; capture length budgets in the content guide.
15. Text Spacing. Implement typographic rhythm in src/pages/TrustCenter.jsx with 4/8/12px increments, consistent line-heights, and purposeful white space so dense data still breathes.
16. Shaping. Align corners, chips, and avatar cuts in src/pages/TrustCenter.jsx to the shared 8/12/16 radius matrix; include shape tokens for states like pressed or focused.
17. Shadow, hover, glow and effects. Limit src/pages/TrustCenter.jsx to brand-sanctioned elevations and transitions; codify hover, focus, and pressed states with measurable durations and easing curves.
18. Thumbnails. Audit any media or thumbnail surfaces inside src/pages/TrustCenter.jsx; enforce standardized aspect ratios, fallback illustrations, and lazy-loading placeholders.
19. Images and media & Images and media previews. Route all media requests in src/pages/TrustCenter.jsx through the optimized CDN pipeline with responsive sourcesets, skeleton states, and upload progress indicators.
20. Button styling. Enforce the slim 40-44px high button variants in src/pages/TrustCenter.jsx, with icon-leading, text-only, and destructive options backed by accessible focus outlines.
21. Interactiveness. Instrument src/pages/TrustCenter.jsx with keyboard navigation, screen-reader announcements, pointer and touch gestures, and micro-animations aligned to Material motion values.
22. Missing Components. Confirm whether src/pages/TrustCenter.jsx requires supporting elements like tooltips, empty states, or inline coaching; design and implement them if absent so flows never dead-end.
23. Design Changes. Map src/pages/TrustCenter.jsx to the refined information architecture, ensuring entry points, breadcrumbs, and contextual actions reflect the simplified mental model.
24. Design Duplication. Register src/pages/TrustCenter.jsx in the design system catalogue with a canonical spec so teams stop forking the UI for similar needs.
25. Design framework. Publish component docs for src/pages/TrustCenter.jsx covering props, data contracts, accessibility, theming, QA steps, and code samples inside Storybook/Chromatic.
26. Mobile App Functionality. Mirror src/pages/TrustCenter.jsx's functionality in Flutter or native modules by exporting schema types, event contracts, and UI mocks to the mobile squad.
27. Mobile App Styling. Deliver color, typography, and spacing tokens derived from src/pages/TrustCenter.jsx to the mobile theming pipeline so parity is preserved across devices.
28. Change Checklist Tracker Extensive. Track src/pages/TrustCenter.jsx's rebuild in the program board with tasks for design sign-off, unit tests, integration tests, localization, analytics, release notes, and playbook updates.
29. Full Upgrade Plan & Release Steps  Extensive. Run src/pages/TrustCenter.jsx through feature-flagged rollout: ship to internal alpha, capture metrics, fix defects, graduate to beta cohorts, prepare comms, then launch globally.

2.B.8 src/components/support/SecurityPillars.jsx — Expanded Component Blueprint
1. Appraisal. src/components/support/SecurityPillars.jsx sits on legacy scaffolding that tangles presentation and business concerns; capture an exhaustive inventory of props, context, and downstream consumers before the redesign begins so no path is missed.
2. Functionality. Audit every event handler inside src/components/support/SecurityPillars.jsx and document success, failure, and loading states; wire them to integration tests that simulate desktop, tablet, and mobile behaviours.
3. Logic Usefulness. Trace the logic stack for src/components/support/SecurityPillars.jsx from data request to render and challenge each conditional; if the logic does not deliver measurable user value or analytics insight, move it to backlog or delete it.
4. Redundancies. Compare src/components/support/SecurityPillars.jsx with sibling modules to remove duplicated utilities, nested wrappers, or styling fragments; publish a diff in the component registry before merging changes.
5. Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs. Replace any placeholder links, TODO blocks, or stub async functions in src/components/support/SecurityPillars.jsx with production-ready flows or delete them outright so the experience is never half-finished.
6. Duplicate Functions. Merge repeated helper functions in src/components/support/SecurityPillars.jsx into shared hooks and memoized selectors; annotate the removal in changelog entries so other squads can update imports.
7. Improvements need to make. Build a Figma-aligned implementation brief for src/components/support/SecurityPillars.jsx that includes acceptance criteria, telemetry goals, accessibility checklists, and rollout guardrails.
8. Styling improvements. Translate the high-fidelity tokens to src/components/support/SecurityPillars.jsx with explicit specs for spacing, typography, radii, and shadows; reject any variance greater than 1px or 1dp when doing visual QA.
9. Efficiency analysis and improvement. Profile src/components/support/SecurityPillars.jsx with React Profiler (or relevant tooling) to eliminate wasted renders, heavy bundles, and blocking network waterfalls; capture before-and-after metrics.
10. Strengths to Keep. Catalog the behaviours in src/components/support/SecurityPillars.jsx that users rely on—keyboard shortcuts, progressive disclosure, crisp copy—and lock them into regression tests so they are preserved during overhaul.
11. Weaknesses to remove. Identify every confusing micro-interaction, misaligned icon, or inconsistent layout within src/components/support/SecurityPillars.jsx and remove them during the redesign sprint; document the removals for stakeholder sign-off.
12. Styling and Colour review changes. Apply the approved navy-slate base palette and coral accents to src/components/support/SecurityPillars.jsx, validate contrast ratios, and add dark-mode tokens to the design tokens library.
13. Css, orientation, placement and arrangement changes. Recompose src/components/support/SecurityPillars.jsx using modern layout primitives (flex/grid/auto layout) with defined breakpoints for desktop, tablet, and mobile to keep orientation predictable.
14. Text analysis, text placement, text length, text redundancy and quality of text analysis. Rewrite every string rendered by src/components/support/SecurityPillars.jsx so it is sharp, user-focused, and internationalization-ready; capture length budgets in the content guide.
15. Text Spacing. Implement typographic rhythm in src/components/support/SecurityPillars.jsx with 4/8/12px increments, consistent line-heights, and purposeful white space so dense data still breathes.
16. Shaping. Align corners, chips, and avatar cuts in src/components/support/SecurityPillars.jsx to the shared 8/12/16 radius matrix; include shape tokens for states like pressed or focused.
17. Shadow, hover, glow and effects. Limit src/components/support/SecurityPillars.jsx to brand-sanctioned elevations and transitions; codify hover, focus, and pressed states with measurable durations and easing curves.
18. Thumbnails. Audit any media or thumbnail surfaces inside src/components/support/SecurityPillars.jsx; enforce standardized aspect ratios, fallback illustrations, and lazy-loading placeholders.
19. Images and media & Images and media previews. Route all media requests in src/components/support/SecurityPillars.jsx through the optimized CDN pipeline with responsive sourcesets, skeleton states, and upload progress indicators.
20. Button styling. Enforce the slim 40-44px high button variants in src/components/support/SecurityPillars.jsx, with icon-leading, text-only, and destructive options backed by accessible focus outlines.
21. Interactiveness. Instrument src/components/support/SecurityPillars.jsx with keyboard navigation, screen-reader announcements, pointer and touch gestures, and micro-animations aligned to Material motion values.

3.A.2 src/pages/RegisterPage.jsx — Expanded Component Blueprint
1. Appraisal. src/pages/RegisterPage.jsx sits on legacy scaffolding that tangles presentation and business concerns; capture an exhaustive inventory of props, context, and downstream consumers before the redesign begins so no path is missed.
2. Functionality. Audit every event handler inside src/pages/RegisterPage.jsx and document success, failure, and loading states; wire them to integration tests that simulate desktop, tablet, and mobile behaviours.
3. Logic Usefulness. Trace the logic stack for src/pages/RegisterPage.jsx from data request to render and challenge each conditional; if the logic does not deliver measurable user value or analytics insight, move it to backlog or delete it.
4. Redundancies. Compare src/pages/RegisterPage.jsx with sibling modules to remove duplicated utilities, nested wrappers, or styling fragments; publish a diff in the component registry before merging changes.
5. Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs. Replace any placeholder links, TODO blocks, or stub async functions in src/pages/RegisterPage.jsx with production-ready flows or delete them outright so the experience is never half-finished.
6. Duplicate Functions. Merge repeated helper functions in src/pages/RegisterPage.jsx into shared hooks and memoized selectors; annotate the removal in changelog entries so other squads can update imports.
7. Improvements need to make. Build a Figma-aligned implementation brief for src/pages/RegisterPage.jsx that includes acceptance criteria, telemetry goals, accessibility checklists, and rollout guardrails.
8. Styling improvements. Translate the high-fidelity tokens to src/pages/RegisterPage.jsx with explicit specs for spacing, typography, radii, and shadows; reject any variance greater than 1px or 1dp when doing visual QA.
9. Efficiency analysis and improvement. Profile src/pages/RegisterPage.jsx with React Profiler (or relevant tooling) to eliminate wasted renders, heavy bundles, and blocking network waterfalls; capture before-and-after metrics.
10. Strengths to Keep. Catalog the behaviours in src/pages/RegisterPage.jsx that users rely on—keyboard shortcuts, progressive disclosure, crisp copy—and lock them into regression tests so they are preserved during overhaul.
11. Weaknesses to remove. Identify every confusing micro-interaction, misaligned icon, or inconsistent layout within src/pages/RegisterPage.jsx and remove them during the redesign sprint; document the removals for stakeholder sign-off.
12. Styling and Colour review changes. Apply the approved navy-slate base palette and coral accents to src/pages/RegisterPage.jsx, validate contrast ratios, and add dark-mode tokens to the design tokens library.
13. Css, orientation, placement and arrangement changes. Recompose src/pages/RegisterPage.jsx using modern layout primitives (flex/grid/auto layout) with defined breakpoints for desktop, tablet, and mobile to keep orientation predictable.
14. Text analysis, text placement, text length, text redundancy and quality of text analysis. Rewrite every string rendered by src/pages/RegisterPage.jsx so it is sharp, user-focused, and internationalization-ready; capture length budgets in the content guide.
15. Text Spacing. Implement typographic rhythm in src/pages/RegisterPage.jsx with 4/8/12px increments, consistent line-heights, and purposeful white space so dense data still breathes.
16. Shaping. Align corners, chips, and avatar cuts in src/pages/RegisterPage.jsx to the shared 8/12/16 radius matrix; include shape tokens for states like pressed or focused.
17. Shadow, hover, glow and effects. Limit src/pages/RegisterPage.jsx to brand-sanctioned elevations and transitions; codify hover, focus, and pressed states with measurable durations and easing curves.
18. Thumbnails. Audit any media or thumbnail surfaces inside src/pages/RegisterPage.jsx; enforce standardized aspect ratios, fallback illustrations, and lazy-loading placeholders.
19. Images and media & Images and media previews. Route all media requests in src/pages/RegisterPage.jsx through the optimized CDN pipeline with responsive sourcesets, skeleton states, and upload progress indicators.
20. Button styling. Enforce the slim 40-44px high button variants in src/pages/RegisterPage.jsx, with icon-leading, text-only, and destructive options backed by accessible focus outlines.
21. Interactiveness. Instrument src/pages/RegisterPage.jsx with keyboard navigation, screen-reader announcements, pointer and touch gestures, and micro-animations aligned to Material motion values.
22. Missing Components. Confirm whether src/pages/RegisterPage.jsx requires supporting elements like tooltips, empty states, or inline coaching; design and implement them if absent so flows never dead-end.
23. Design Changes. Map src/pages/RegisterPage.jsx to the refined information architecture, ensuring entry points, breadcrumbs, and contextual actions reflect the simplified mental model.
24. Design Duplication. Register src/pages/RegisterPage.jsx in the design system catalogue with a canonical spec so teams stop forking the UI for similar needs.
25. Design framework. Publish component docs for src/pages/RegisterPage.jsx covering props, data contracts, accessibility, theming, QA steps, and code samples inside Storybook/Chromatic.
26. Mobile App Functionality. Mirror src/pages/RegisterPage.jsx's functionality in Flutter or native modules by exporting schema types, event contracts, and UI mocks to the mobile squad.

3.A.8 src/components/auth/TwoFactorPrompt.jsx — Expanded Component Blueprint
1. Appraisal. src/components/auth/TwoFactorPrompt.jsx sits on legacy scaffolding that tangles presentation and business concerns; capture an exhaustive inventory of props, context, and downstream consumers before the redesign begins so no path is missed.
2. Functionality. Audit every event handler inside src/components/auth/TwoFactorPrompt.jsx and document success, failure, and loading states; wire them to integration tests that simulate desktop, tablet, and mobile behaviours.
3. Logic Usefulness. Trace the logic stack for src/components/auth/TwoFactorPrompt.jsx from data request to render and challenge each conditional; if the logic does not deliver measurable user value or analytics insight, move it to backlog or delete it.
4. Redundancies. Compare src/components/auth/TwoFactorPrompt.jsx with sibling modules to remove duplicated utilities, nested wrappers, or styling fragments; publish a diff in the component registry before merging changes.
5. Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs. Replace any placeholder links, TODO blocks, or stub async functions in src/components/auth/TwoFactorPrompt.jsx with production-ready flows or delete them outright so the experience is never half-finished.
6. Duplicate Functions. Merge repeated helper functions in src/components/auth/TwoFactorPrompt.jsx into shared hooks and memoized selectors; annotate the removal in changelog entries so other squads can update imports.
7. Improvements need to make. Build a Figma-aligned implementation brief for src/components/auth/TwoFactorPrompt.jsx that includes acceptance criteria, telemetry goals, accessibility checklists, and rollout guardrails.
8. Styling improvements. Translate the high-fidelity tokens to src/components/auth/TwoFactorPrompt.jsx with explicit specs for spacing, typography, radii, and shadows; reject any variance greater than 1px or 1dp when doing visual QA.
9. Efficiency analysis and improvement. Profile src/components/auth/TwoFactorPrompt.jsx with React Profiler (or relevant tooling) to eliminate wasted renders, heavy bundles, and blocking network waterfalls; capture before-and-after metrics.
10. Strengths to Keep. Catalog the behaviours in src/components/auth/TwoFactorPrompt.jsx that users rely on—keyboard shortcuts, progressive disclosure, crisp copy—and lock them into regression tests so they are preserved during overhaul.
11. Weaknesses to remove. Identify every confusing micro-interaction, misaligned icon, or inconsistent layout within src/components/auth/TwoFactorPrompt.jsx and remove them during the redesign sprint; document the removals for stakeholder sign-off.
12. Styling and Colour review changes. Apply the approved navy-slate base palette and coral accents to src/components/auth/TwoFactorPrompt.jsx, validate contrast ratios, and add dark-mode tokens to the design tokens library.
13. Css, orientation, placement and arrangement changes. Recompose src/components/auth/TwoFactorPrompt.jsx using modern layout primitives (flex/grid/auto layout) with defined breakpoints for desktop, tablet, and mobile to keep orientation predictable.
14. Text analysis, text placement, text length, text redundancy and quality of text analysis. Rewrite every string rendered by src/components/auth/TwoFactorPrompt.jsx so it is sharp, user-focused, and internationalization-ready; capture length budgets in the content guide.

2. Functionality. Audit every event handler inside src/services/auth/socialAuthService.js and document success, failure, and loading states; wire them to integration tests that simulate desktop, tablet, and mobile behaviours.
3. Logic Usefulness. Trace the logic stack for src/services/auth/socialAuthService.js from data request to render and challenge each conditional; if the logic does not deliver measurable user value or analytics insight, move it to backlog or delete it.
4. Redundancies. Compare src/services/auth/socialAuthService.js with sibling modules to remove duplicated utilities, nested wrappers, or styling fragments; publish a diff in the component registry before merging changes.
5. Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs. Replace any placeholder links, TODO blocks, or stub async functions in src/services/auth/socialAuthService.js with production-ready flows or delete them outright so the experience is never half-finished.
6. Duplicate Functions. Merge repeated helper functions in src/services/auth/socialAuthService.js into shared hooks and memoized selectors; annotate the removal in changelog entries so other squads can update imports.
7. Improvements need to make. Build a Figma-aligned implementation brief for src/services/auth/socialAuthService.js that includes acceptance criteria, telemetry goals, accessibility checklists, and rollout guardrails.
8. Styling improvements. Translate the high-fidelity tokens to src/services/auth/socialAuthService.js with explicit specs for spacing, typography, radii, and shadows; reject any variance greater than 1px or 1dp when doing visual QA.
9. Efficiency analysis and improvement. Profile src/services/auth/socialAuthService.js with React Profiler (or relevant tooling) to eliminate wasted renders, heavy bundles, and blocking network waterfalls; capture before-and-after metrics.
10. Strengths to Keep. Catalog the behaviours in src/services/auth/socialAuthService.js that users rely on—keyboard shortcuts, progressive disclosure, crisp copy—and lock them into regression tests so they are preserved during overhaul.
11. Weaknesses to remove. Identify every confusing micro-interaction, misaligned icon, or inconsistent layout within src/services/auth/socialAuthService.js and remove them during the redesign sprint; document the removals for stakeholder sign-off.
12. Styling and Colour review changes. Apply the approved navy-slate base palette and coral accents to src/services/auth/socialAuthService.js, validate contrast ratios, and add dark-mode tokens to the design tokens library.
13. Css, orientation, placement and arrangement changes. Recompose src/services/auth/socialAuthService.js using modern layout primitives (flex/grid/auto layout) with defined breakpoints for desktop, tablet, and mobile to keep orientation predictable.
14. Text analysis, text placement, text length, text redundancy and quality of text analysis. Rewrite every string rendered by src/services/auth/socialAuthService.js so it is sharp, user-focused, and internationalization-ready; capture length budgets in the content guide.
15. Text Spacing. Implement typographic rhythm in src/services/auth/socialAuthService.js with 4/8/12px increments, consistent line-heights, and purposeful white space so dense data still breathes.
16. Shaping. Align corners, chips, and avatar cuts in src/services/auth/socialAuthService.js to the shared 8/12/16 radius matrix; include shape tokens for states like pressed or focused.
17. Shadow, hover, glow and effects. Limit src/services/auth/socialAuthService.js to brand-sanctioned elevations and transitions; codify hover, focus, and pressed states with measurable durations and easing curves.
18. Thumbnails. Audit any media or thumbnail surfaces inside src/services/auth/socialAuthService.js; enforce standardized aspect ratios, fallback illustrations, and lazy-loading placeholders.
19. Images and media & Images and media previews. Route all media requests in src/services/auth/socialAuthService.js through the optimized CDN pipeline with responsive sourcesets, skeleton states, and upload progress indicators.
20. Button styling. Enforce the slim 40-44px high button variants in src/services/auth/socialAuthService.js, with icon-leading, text-only, and destructive options backed by accessible focus outlines.
21. Interactiveness. Instrument src/services/auth/socialAuthService.js with keyboard navigation, screen-reader announcements, pointer and touch gestures, and micro-animations aligned to Material motion values.
22. Missing Components. Confirm whether src/services/auth/socialAuthService.js requires supporting elements like tooltips, empty states, or inline coaching; design and implement them if absent so flows never dead-end.
23. Design Changes. Map src/services/auth/socialAuthService.js to the refined information architecture, ensuring entry points, breadcrumbs, and contextual actions reflect the simplified mental model.
24. Design Duplication. Register src/services/auth/socialAuthService.js in the design system catalogue with a canonical spec so teams stop forking the UI for similar needs.
25. Design framework. Publish component docs for src/services/auth/socialAuthService.js covering props, data contracts, accessibility, theming, QA steps, and code samples inside Storybook/Chromatic.
26. Mobile App Functionality. Mirror src/services/auth/socialAuthService.js's functionality in Flutter or native modules by exporting schema types, event contracts, and UI mocks to the mobile squad.
27. Mobile App Styling. Deliver color, typography, and spacing tokens derived from src/services/auth/socialAuthService.js to the mobile theming pipeline so parity is preserved across devices.
28. Change Checklist Tracker Extensive. Track src/services/auth/socialAuthService.js's rebuild in the program board with tasks for design sign-off, unit tests, integration tests, localization, analytics, release notes, and playbook updates.
29. Full Upgrade Plan & Release Steps  Extensive. Run src/services/auth/socialAuthService.js through feature-flagged rollout: ship to internal alpha, capture metrics, fix defects, graduate to beta cohorts, prepare comms, then launch globally.

3.C.6 src/routes/ProtectedRoutes.jsx (and related route guards) — Expanded Component Blueprint
1. Appraisal. src/routes/ProtectedRoutes.jsx (and related route guards) sits on legacy scaffolding that tangles presentation and business concerns; capture an exhaustive inventory of props, context, and downstream consumers before the redesign begins so no path is missed.
2. Functionality. Audit every event handler inside src/routes/ProtectedRoutes.jsx (and related route guards) and document success, failure, and loading states; wire them to integration tests that simulate desktop, tablet, and mobile behaviours.
3. Logic Usefulness. Trace the logic stack for src/routes/ProtectedRoutes.jsx (and related route guards) from data request to render and challenge each conditional; if the logic does not deliver measurable user value or analytics insight, move it to backlog or delete it.
4. Redundancies. Compare src/routes/ProtectedRoutes.jsx (and related route guards) with sibling modules to remove duplicated utilities, nested wrappers, or styling fragments; publish a diff in the component registry before merging changes.
5. Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs. Replace any placeholder links, TODO blocks, or stub async functions in src/routes/ProtectedRoutes.jsx (and related route guards) with production-ready flows or delete them outright so the experience is never half-finished.
6. Duplicate Functions. Merge repeated helper functions in src/routes/ProtectedRoutes.jsx (and related route guards) into shared hooks and memoized selectors; annotate the removal in changelog entries so other squads can update imports.
7. Improvements need to make. Build a Figma-aligned implementation brief for src/routes/ProtectedRoutes.jsx (and related route guards) that includes acceptance criteria, telemetry goals, accessibility checklists, and rollout guardrails.
8. Styling improvements. Translate the high-fidelity tokens to src/routes/ProtectedRoutes.jsx (and related route guards) with explicit specs for spacing, typography, radii, and shadows; reject any variance greater than 1px or 1dp when doing visual QA.
9. Efficiency analysis and improvement. Profile src/routes/ProtectedRoutes.jsx (and related route guards) with React Profiler (or relevant tooling) to eliminate wasted renders, heavy bundles, and blocking network waterfalls; capture before-and-after metrics.
10. Strengths to Keep. Catalog the behaviours in src/routes/ProtectedRoutes.jsx (and related route guards) that users rely on—keyboard shortcuts, progressive disclosure, crisp copy—and lock them into regression tests so they are preserved during overhaul.
11. Weaknesses to remove. Identify every confusing micro-interaction, misaligned icon, or inconsistent layout within src/routes/ProtectedRoutes.jsx (and related route guards) and remove them during the redesign sprint; document the removals for stakeholder sign-off.
12. Styling and Colour review changes. Apply the approved navy-slate base palette and coral accents to src/routes/ProtectedRoutes.jsx (and related route guards), validate contrast ratios, and add dark-mode tokens to the design tokens library.
13. Css, orientation, placement and arrangement changes. Recompose src/routes/ProtectedRoutes.jsx (and related route guards) using modern layout primitives (flex/grid/auto layout) with defined breakpoints for desktop, tablet, and mobile to keep orientation predictable.
14. Text analysis, text placement, text length, text redundancy and quality of text analysis. Rewrite every string rendered by src/routes/ProtectedRoutes.jsx (and related route guards) so it is sharp, user-focused, and internationalization-ready; capture length budgets in the content guide.
15. Text Spacing. Implement typographic rhythm in src/routes/ProtectedRoutes.jsx (and related route guards) with 4/8/12px increments, consistent line-heights, and purposeful white space so dense data still breathes.
16. Shaping. Align corners, chips, and avatar cuts in src/routes/ProtectedRoutes.jsx (and related route guards) to the shared 8/12/16 radius matrix; include shape tokens for states like pressed or focused.
17. Shadow, hover, glow and effects. Limit src/routes/ProtectedRoutes.jsx (and related route guards) to brand-sanctioned elevations and transitions; codify hover, focus, and pressed states with measurable durations and easing curves.

1. Appraisal. src/components/userDashboard/TaskList.jsx sits on legacy scaffolding that tangles presentation and business concerns; capture an exhaustive inventory of props, context, and downstream consumers before the redesign begins so no path is missed.
2. Functionality. Audit every event handler inside src/components/userDashboard/TaskList.jsx and document success, failure, and loading states; wire them to integration tests that simulate desktop, tablet, and mobile behaviours.
3. Logic Usefulness. Trace the logic stack for src/components/userDashboard/TaskList.jsx from data request to render and challenge each conditional; if the logic does not deliver measurable user value or analytics insight, move it to backlog or delete it.
4. Redundancies. Compare src/components/userDashboard/TaskList.jsx with sibling modules to remove duplicated utilities, nested wrappers, or styling fragments; publish a diff in the component registry before merging changes.
5. Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs. Replace any placeholder links, TODO blocks, or stub async functions in src/components/userDashboard/TaskList.jsx with production-ready flows or delete them outright so the experience is never half-finished.
6. Duplicate Functions. Merge repeated helper functions in src/components/userDashboard/TaskList.jsx into shared hooks and memoized selectors; annotate the removal in changelog entries so other squads can update imports.
7. Improvements need to make. Build a Figma-aligned implementation brief for src/components/userDashboard/TaskList.jsx that includes acceptance criteria, telemetry goals, accessibility checklists, and rollout guardrails.
8. Styling improvements. Translate the high-fidelity tokens to src/components/userDashboard/TaskList.jsx with explicit specs for spacing, typography, radii, and shadows; reject any variance greater than 1px or 1dp when doing visual QA.
9. Efficiency analysis and improvement. Profile src/components/userDashboard/TaskList.jsx with React Profiler (or relevant tooling) to eliminate wasted renders, heavy bundles, and blocking network waterfalls; capture before-and-after metrics.
10. Strengths to Keep. Catalog the behaviours in src/components/userDashboard/TaskList.jsx that users rely on—keyboard shortcuts, progressive disclosure, crisp copy—and lock them into regression tests so they are preserved during overhaul.
11. Weaknesses to remove. Identify every confusing micro-interaction, misaligned icon, or inconsistent layout within src/components/userDashboard/TaskList.jsx and remove them during the redesign sprint; document the removals for stakeholder sign-off.
12. Styling and Colour review changes. Apply the approved navy-slate base palette and coral accents to src/components/userDashboard/TaskList.jsx, validate contrast ratios, and add dark-mode tokens to the design tokens library.
13. Css, orientation, placement and arrangement changes. Recompose src/components/userDashboard/TaskList.jsx using modern layout primitives (flex/grid/auto layout) with defined breakpoints for desktop, tablet, and mobile to keep orientation predictable.
14. Text analysis, text placement, text length, text redundancy and quality of text analysis. Rewrite every string rendered by src/components/userDashboard/TaskList.jsx so it is sharp, user-focused, and internationalization-ready; capture length budgets in the content guide.
15. Text Spacing. Implement typographic rhythm in src/components/userDashboard/TaskList.jsx with 4/8/12px increments, consistent line-heights, and purposeful white space so dense data still breathes.
16. Shaping. Align corners, chips, and avatar cuts in src/components/userDashboard/TaskList.jsx to the shared 8/12/16 radius matrix; include shape tokens for states like pressed or focused.
17. Shadow, hover, glow and effects. Limit src/components/userDashboard/TaskList.jsx to brand-sanctioned elevations and transitions; codify hover, focus, and pressed states with measurable durations and easing curves.
18. Thumbnails. Audit any media or thumbnail surfaces inside src/components/userDashboard/TaskList.jsx; enforce standardized aspect ratios, fallback illustrations, and lazy-loading placeholders.
19. Images and media & Images and media previews. Route all media requests in src/components/userDashboard/TaskList.jsx through the optimized CDN pipeline with responsive sourcesets, skeleton states, and upload progress indicators.
20. Button styling. Enforce the slim 40-44px high button variants in src/components/userDashboard/TaskList.jsx, with icon-leading, text-only, and destructive options backed by accessible focus outlines.
21. Interactiveness. Instrument src/components/userDashboard/TaskList.jsx with keyboard navigation, screen-reader announcements, pointer and touch gestures, and micro-animations aligned to Material motion values.
22. Missing Components. Confirm whether src/components/userDashboard/TaskList.jsx requires supporting elements like tooltips, empty states, or inline coaching; design and implement them if absent so flows never dead-end.
23. Design Changes. Map src/components/userDashboard/TaskList.jsx to the refined information architecture, ensuring entry points, breadcrumbs, and contextual actions reflect the simplified mental model.
24. Design Duplication. Register src/components/userDashboard/TaskList.jsx in the design system catalogue with a canonical spec so teams stop forking the UI for similar needs.
25. Design framework. Publish component docs for src/components/userDashboard/TaskList.jsx covering props, data contracts, accessibility, theming, QA steps, and code samples inside Storybook/Chromatic.
26. Mobile App Functionality. Mirror src/components/userDashboard/TaskList.jsx's functionality in Flutter or native modules by exporting schema types, event contracts, and UI mocks to the mobile squad.

4.B.1 src/pages/ProfilePage.jsx — Expanded Component Blueprint
1. Appraisal. src/pages/ProfilePage.jsx sits on legacy scaffolding that tangles presentation and business concerns; capture an exhaustive inventory of props, context, and downstream consumers before the redesign begins so no path is missed.
2. Functionality. Audit every event handler inside src/pages/ProfilePage.jsx and document success, failure, and loading states; wire them to integration tests that simulate desktop, tablet, and mobile behaviours.
3. Logic Usefulness. Trace the logic stack for src/pages/ProfilePage.jsx from data request to render and challenge each conditional; if the logic does not deliver measurable user value or analytics insight, move it to backlog or delete it.
4. Redundancies. Compare src/pages/ProfilePage.jsx with sibling modules to remove duplicated utilities, nested wrappers, or styling fragments; publish a diff in the component registry before merging changes.
5. Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs. Replace any placeholder links, TODO blocks, or stub async functions in src/pages/ProfilePage.jsx with production-ready flows or delete them outright so the experience is never half-finished.
6. Duplicate Functions. Merge repeated helper functions in src/pages/ProfilePage.jsx into shared hooks and memoized selectors; annotate the removal in changelog entries so other squads can update imports.
7. Improvements need to make. Build a Figma-aligned implementation brief for src/pages/ProfilePage.jsx that includes acceptance criteria, telemetry goals, accessibility checklists, and rollout guardrails.
8. Styling improvements. Translate the high-fidelity tokens to src/pages/ProfilePage.jsx with explicit specs for spacing, typography, radii, and shadows; reject any variance greater than 1px or 1dp when doing visual QA.
9. Efficiency analysis and improvement. Profile src/pages/ProfilePage.jsx with React Profiler (or relevant tooling) to eliminate wasted renders, heavy bundles, and blocking network waterfalls; capture before-and-after metrics.
10. Strengths to Keep. Catalog the behaviours in src/pages/ProfilePage.jsx that users rely on—keyboard shortcuts, progressive disclosure, crisp copy—and lock them into regression tests so they are preserved during overhaul.
11. Weaknesses to remove. Identify every confusing micro-interaction, misaligned icon, or inconsistent layout within src/pages/ProfilePage.jsx and remove them during the redesign sprint; document the removals for stakeholder sign-off.
12. Styling and Colour review changes. Apply the approved navy-slate base palette and coral accents to src/pages/ProfilePage.jsx, validate contrast ratios, and add dark-mode tokens to the design tokens library.

2. Functionality. Audit every event handler inside src/components/profileSettings/ProfileSidebar.jsx and document success, failure, and loading states; wire them to integration tests that simulate desktop, tablet, and mobile behaviours.
3. Logic Usefulness. Trace the logic stack for src/components/profileSettings/ProfileSidebar.jsx from data request to render and challenge each conditional; if the logic does not deliver measurable user value or analytics insight, move it to backlog or delete it.
4. Redundancies. Compare src/components/profileSettings/ProfileSidebar.jsx with sibling modules to remove duplicated utilities, nested wrappers, or styling fragments; publish a diff in the component registry before merging changes.
5. Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs. Replace any placeholder links, TODO blocks, or stub async functions in src/components/profileSettings/ProfileSidebar.jsx with production-ready flows or delete them outright so the experience is never half-finished.
6. Duplicate Functions. Merge repeated helper functions in src/components/profileSettings/ProfileSidebar.jsx into shared hooks and memoized selectors; annotate the removal in changelog entries so other squads can update imports.
7. Improvements need to make. Build a Figma-aligned implementation brief for src/components/profileSettings/ProfileSidebar.jsx that includes acceptance criteria, telemetry goals, accessibility checklists, and rollout guardrails.
8. Styling improvements. Translate the high-fidelity tokens to src/components/profileSettings/ProfileSidebar.jsx with explicit specs for spacing, typography, radii, and shadows; reject any variance greater than 1px or 1dp when doing visual QA.
9. Efficiency analysis and improvement. Profile src/components/profileSettings/ProfileSidebar.jsx with React Profiler (or relevant tooling) to eliminate wasted renders, heavy bundles, and blocking network waterfalls; capture before-and-after metrics.
10. Strengths to Keep. Catalog the behaviours in src/components/profileSettings/ProfileSidebar.jsx that users rely on—keyboard shortcuts, progressive disclosure, crisp copy—and lock them into regression tests so they are preserved during overhaul.
11. Weaknesses to remove. Identify every confusing micro-interaction, misaligned icon, or inconsistent layout within src/components/profileSettings/ProfileSidebar.jsx and remove them during the redesign sprint; document the removals for stakeholder sign-off.
12. Styling and Colour review changes. Apply the approved navy-slate base palette and coral accents to src/components/profileSettings/ProfileSidebar.jsx, validate contrast ratios, and add dark-mode tokens to the design tokens library.
13. Css, orientation, placement and arrangement changes. Recompose src/components/profileSettings/ProfileSidebar.jsx using modern layout primitives (flex/grid/auto layout) with defined breakpoints for desktop, tablet, and mobile to keep orientation predictable.
14. Text analysis, text placement, text length, text redundancy and quality of text analysis. Rewrite every string rendered by src/components/profileSettings/ProfileSidebar.jsx so it is sharp, user-focused, and internationalization-ready; capture length budgets in the content guide.
15. Text Spacing. Implement typographic rhythm in src/components/profileSettings/ProfileSidebar.jsx with 4/8/12px increments, consistent line-heights, and purposeful white space so dense data still breathes.
16. Shaping. Align corners, chips, and avatar cuts in src/components/profileSettings/ProfileSidebar.jsx to the shared 8/12/16 radius matrix; include shape tokens for states like pressed or focused.
17. Shadow, hover, glow and effects. Limit src/components/profileSettings/ProfileSidebar.jsx to brand-sanctioned elevations and transitions; codify hover, focus, and pressed states with measurable durations and easing curves.
18. Thumbnails. Audit any media or thumbnail surfaces inside src/components/profileSettings/ProfileSidebar.jsx; enforce standardized aspect ratios, fallback illustrations, and lazy-loading placeholders.
19. Images and media & Images and media previews. Route all media requests in src/components/profileSettings/ProfileSidebar.jsx through the optimized CDN pipeline with responsive sourcesets, skeleton states, and upload progress indicators.
20. Button styling. Enforce the slim 40-44px high button variants in src/components/profileSettings/ProfileSidebar.jsx, with icon-leading, text-only, and destructive options backed by accessible focus outlines.
21. Interactiveness. Instrument src/components/profileSettings/ProfileSidebar.jsx with keyboard navigation, screen-reader announcements, pointer and touch gestures, and micro-animations aligned to Material motion values.
22. Missing Components. Confirm whether src/components/profileSettings/ProfileSidebar.jsx requires supporting elements like tooltips, empty states, or inline coaching; design and implement them if absent so flows never dead-end.
23. Design Changes. Map src/components/profileSettings/ProfileSidebar.jsx to the refined information architecture, ensuring entry points, breadcrumbs, and contextual actions reflect the simplified mental model.
24. Design Duplication. Register src/components/profileSettings/ProfileSidebar.jsx in the design system catalogue with a canonical spec so teams stop forking the UI for similar needs.
25. Design framework. Publish component docs for src/components/profileSettings/ProfileSidebar.jsx covering props, data contracts, accessibility, theming, QA steps, and code samples inside Storybook/Chromatic.
26. Mobile App Functionality. Mirror src/components/profileSettings/ProfileSidebar.jsx's functionality in Flutter or native modules by exporting schema types, event contracts, and UI mocks to the mobile squad.
27. Mobile App Styling. Deliver color, typography, and spacing tokens derived from src/components/profileSettings/ProfileSidebar.jsx to the mobile theming pipeline so parity is preserved across devices.
28. Change Checklist Tracker Extensive. Track src/components/profileSettings/ProfileSidebar.jsx's rebuild in the program board with tasks for design sign-off, unit tests, integration tests, localization, analytics, release notes, and playbook updates.
29. Full Upgrade Plan & Release Steps  Extensive. Run src/components/profileSettings/ProfileSidebar.jsx through feature-flagged rollout: ship to internal alpha, capture metrics, fix defects, graduate to beta cohorts, prepare comms, then launch globally.

4.B.12 src/components/profileSettings/VisibilitySettings.jsx — Expanded Component Blueprint
1. Appraisal. src/components/profileSettings/VisibilitySettings.jsx sits on legacy scaffolding that tangles presentation and business concerns; capture an exhaustive inventory of props, context, and downstream consumers before the redesign begins so no path is missed.
2. Functionality. Audit every event handler inside src/components/profileSettings/VisibilitySettings.jsx and document success, failure, and loading states; wire them to integration tests that simulate desktop, tablet, and mobile behaviours.
3. Logic Usefulness. Trace the logic stack for src/components/profileSettings/VisibilitySettings.jsx from data request to render and challenge each conditional; if the logic does not deliver measurable user value or analytics insight, move it to backlog or delete it.
4. Redundancies. Compare src/components/profileSettings/VisibilitySettings.jsx with sibling modules to remove duplicated utilities, nested wrappers, or styling fragments; publish a diff in the component registry before merging changes.
5. Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs. Replace any placeholder links, TODO blocks, or stub async functions in src/components/profileSettings/VisibilitySettings.jsx with production-ready flows or delete them outright so the experience is never half-finished.
6. Duplicate Functions. Merge repeated helper functions in src/components/profileSettings/VisibilitySettings.jsx into shared hooks and memoized selectors; annotate the removal in changelog entries so other squads can update imports.
7. Improvements need to make. Build a Figma-aligned implementation brief for src/components/profileSettings/VisibilitySettings.jsx that includes acceptance criteria, telemetry goals, accessibility checklists, and rollout guardrails.
8. Styling improvements. Translate the high-fidelity tokens to src/components/profileSettings/VisibilitySettings.jsx with explicit specs for spacing, typography, radii, and shadows; reject any variance greater than 1px or 1dp when doing visual QA.

4.C.4 src/components/profileSettings/PrivacyControls.jsx — Expanded Component Blueprint
1. Appraisal. src/components/profileSettings/PrivacyControls.jsx sits on legacy scaffolding that tangles presentation and business concerns; capture an exhaustive inventory of props, context, and downstream consumers before the redesign begins so no path is missed.
2. Functionality. Audit every event handler inside src/components/profileSettings/PrivacyControls.jsx and document success, failure, and loading states; wire them to integration tests that simulate desktop, tablet, and mobile behaviours.
3. Logic Usefulness. Trace the logic stack for src/components/profileSettings/PrivacyControls.jsx from data request to render and challenge each conditional; if the logic does not deliver measurable user value or analytics insight, move it to backlog or delete it.
4. Redundancies. Compare src/components/profileSettings/PrivacyControls.jsx with sibling modules to remove duplicated utilities, nested wrappers, or styling fragments; publish a diff in the component registry before merging changes.
5. Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs. Replace any placeholder links, TODO blocks, or stub async functions in src/components/profileSettings/PrivacyControls.jsx with production-ready flows or delete them outright so the experience is never half-finished.
6. Duplicate Functions. Merge repeated helper functions in src/components/profileSettings/PrivacyControls.jsx into shared hooks and memoized selectors; annotate the removal in changelog entries so other squads can update imports.
7. Improvements need to make. Build a Figma-aligned implementation brief for src/components/profileSettings/PrivacyControls.jsx that includes acceptance criteria, telemetry goals, accessibility checklists, and rollout guardrails.
8. Styling improvements. Translate the high-fidelity tokens to src/components/profileSettings/PrivacyControls.jsx with explicit specs for spacing, typography, radii, and shadows; reject any variance greater than 1px or 1dp when doing visual QA.
9. Efficiency analysis and improvement. Profile src/components/profileSettings/PrivacyControls.jsx with React Profiler (or relevant tooling) to eliminate wasted renders, heavy bundles, and blocking network waterfalls; capture before-and-after metrics.
10. Strengths to Keep. Catalog the behaviours in src/components/profileSettings/PrivacyControls.jsx that users rely on—keyboard shortcuts, progressive disclosure, crisp copy—and lock them into regression tests so they are preserved during overhaul.
11. Weaknesses to remove. Identify every confusing micro-interaction, misaligned icon, or inconsistent layout within src/components/profileSettings/PrivacyControls.jsx and remove them during the redesign sprint; document the removals for stakeholder sign-off.
12. Styling and Colour review changes. Apply the approved navy-slate base palette and coral accents to src/components/profileSettings/PrivacyControls.jsx, validate contrast ratios, and add dark-mode tokens to the design tokens library.
13. Css, orientation, placement and arrangement changes. Recompose src/components/profileSettings/PrivacyControls.jsx using modern layout primitives (flex/grid/auto layout) with defined breakpoints for desktop, tablet, and mobile to keep orientation predictable.
14. Text analysis, text placement, text length, text redundancy and quality of text analysis. Rewrite every string rendered by src/components/profileSettings/PrivacyControls.jsx so it is sharp, user-focused, and internationalization-ready; capture length budgets in the content guide.
15. Text Spacing. Implement typographic rhythm in src/components/profileSettings/PrivacyControls.jsx with 4/8/12px increments, consistent line-heights, and purposeful white space so dense data still breathes.
16. Shaping. Align corners, chips, and avatar cuts in src/components/profileSettings/PrivacyControls.jsx to the shared 8/12/16 radius matrix; include shape tokens for states like pressed or focused.
17. Shadow, hover, glow and effects. Limit src/components/profileSettings/PrivacyControls.jsx to brand-sanctioned elevations and transitions; codify hover, focus, and pressed states with measurable durations and easing curves.
18. Thumbnails. Audit any media or thumbnail surfaces inside src/components/profileSettings/PrivacyControls.jsx; enforce standardized aspect ratios, fallback illustrations, and lazy-loading placeholders.
19. Images and media & Images and media previews. Route all media requests in src/components/profileSettings/PrivacyControls.jsx through the optimized CDN pipeline with responsive sourcesets, skeleton states, and upload progress indicators.
20. Button styling. Enforce the slim 40-44px high button variants in src/components/profileSettings/PrivacyControls.jsx, with icon-leading, text-only, and destructive options backed by accessible focus outlines.
21. Interactiveness. Instrument src/components/profileSettings/PrivacyControls.jsx with keyboard navigation, screen-reader announcements, pointer and touch gestures, and micro-animations aligned to Material motion values.
22. Missing Components. Confirm whether src/components/profileSettings/PrivacyControls.jsx requires supporting elements like tooltips, empty states, or inline coaching; design and implement them if absent so flows never dead-end.
23. Design Changes. Map src/components/profileSettings/PrivacyControls.jsx to the refined information architecture, ensuring entry points, breadcrumbs, and contextual actions reflect the simplified mental model.
24. Design Duplication. Register src/components/profileSettings/PrivacyControls.jsx in the design system catalogue with a canonical spec so teams stop forking the UI for similar needs.
25. Design framework. Publish component docs for src/components/profileSettings/PrivacyControls.jsx covering props, data contracts, accessibility, theming, QA steps, and code samples inside Storybook/Chromatic.

5.A.3 src/components/feed/FeedCard.jsx — Expanded Component Blueprint
1. Appraisal. src/components/feed/FeedCard.jsx sits on legacy scaffolding that tangles presentation and business concerns; capture an exhaustive inventory of props, context, and downstream consumers before the redesign begins so no path is missed.
2. Functionality. Audit every event handler inside src/components/feed/FeedCard.jsx and document success, failure, and loading states; wire them to integration tests that simulate desktop, tablet, and mobile behaviours.
3. Logic Usefulness. Trace the logic stack for src/components/feed/FeedCard.jsx from data request to render and challenge each conditional; if the logic does not deliver measurable user value or analytics insight, move it to backlog or delete it.
4. Redundancies. Compare src/components/feed/FeedCard.jsx with sibling modules to remove duplicated utilities, nested wrappers, or styling fragments; publish a diff in the component registry before merging changes.
5. Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs. Replace any placeholder links, TODO blocks, or stub async functions in src/components/feed/FeedCard.jsx with production-ready flows or delete them outright so the experience is never half-finished.

5.A.8 src/components/feed/ShareModal.jsx — Expanded Component Blueprint
1. Appraisal. src/components/feed/ShareModal.jsx sits on legacy scaffolding that tangles presentation and business concerns; capture an exhaustive inventory of props, context, and downstream consumers before the redesign begins so no path is missed.
2. Functionality. Audit every event handler inside src/components/feed/ShareModal.jsx and document success, failure, and loading states; wire them to integration tests that simulate desktop, tablet, and mobile behaviours.
3. Logic Usefulness. Trace the logic stack for src/components/feed/ShareModal.jsx from data request to render and challenge each conditional; if the logic does not deliver measurable user value or analytics insight, move it to backlog or delete it.
4. Redundancies. Compare src/components/feed/ShareModal.jsx with sibling modules to remove duplicated utilities, nested wrappers, or styling fragments; publish a diff in the component registry before merging changes.
5. Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs. Replace any placeholder links, TODO blocks, or stub async functions in src/components/feed/ShareModal.jsx with production-ready flows or delete them outright so the experience is never half-finished.
6. Duplicate Functions. Merge repeated helper functions in src/components/feed/ShareModal.jsx into shared hooks and memoized selectors; annotate the removal in changelog entries so other squads can update imports.
7. Improvements need to make. Build a Figma-aligned implementation brief for src/components/feed/ShareModal.jsx that includes acceptance criteria, telemetry goals, accessibility checklists, and rollout guardrails.
8. Styling improvements. Translate the high-fidelity tokens to src/components/feed/ShareModal.jsx with explicit specs for spacing, typography, radii, and shadows; reject any variance greater than 1px or 1dp when doing visual QA.
9. Efficiency analysis and improvement. Profile src/components/feed/ShareModal.jsx with React Profiler (or relevant tooling) to eliminate wasted renders, heavy bundles, and blocking network waterfalls; capture before-and-after metrics.
10. Strengths to Keep. Catalog the behaviours in src/components/feed/ShareModal.jsx that users rely on—keyboard shortcuts, progressive disclosure, crisp copy—and lock them into regression tests so they are preserved during overhaul.
11. Weaknesses to remove. Identify every confusing micro-interaction, misaligned icon, or inconsistent layout within src/components/feed/ShareModal.jsx and remove them during the redesign sprint; document the removals for stakeholder sign-off.
12. Styling and Colour review changes. Apply the approved navy-slate base palette and coral accents to src/components/feed/ShareModal.jsx, validate contrast ratios, and add dark-mode tokens to the design tokens library.
13. Css, orientation, placement and arrangement changes. Recompose src/components/feed/ShareModal.jsx using modern layout primitives (flex/grid/auto layout) with defined breakpoints for desktop, tablet, and mobile to keep orientation predictable.
14. Text analysis, text placement, text length, text redundancy and quality of text analysis. Rewrite every string rendered by src/components/feed/ShareModal.jsx so it is sharp, user-focused, and internationalization-ready; capture length budgets in the content guide.
15. Text Spacing. Implement typographic rhythm in src/components/feed/ShareModal.jsx with 4/8/12px increments, consistent line-heights, and purposeful white space so dense data still breathes.
16. Shaping. Align corners, chips, and avatar cuts in src/components/feed/ShareModal.jsx to the shared 8/12/16 radius matrix; include shape tokens for states like pressed or focused.
17. Shadow, hover, glow and effects. Limit src/components/feed/ShareModal.jsx to brand-sanctioned elevations and transitions; codify hover, focus, and pressed states with measurable durations and easing curves.
18. Thumbnails. Audit any media or thumbnail surfaces inside src/components/feed/ShareModal.jsx; enforce standardized aspect ratios, fallback illustrations, and lazy-loading placeholders.
19. Images and media & Images and media previews. Route all media requests in src/components/feed/ShareModal.jsx through the optimized CDN pipeline with responsive sourcesets, skeleton states, and upload progress indicators.
20. Button styling. Enforce the slim 40-44px high button variants in src/components/feed/ShareModal.jsx, with icon-leading, text-only, and destructive options backed by accessible focus outlines.
21. Interactiveness. Instrument src/components/feed/ShareModal.jsx with keyboard navigation, screen-reader announcements, pointer and touch gestures, and micro-animations aligned to Material motion values.
22. Missing Components. Confirm whether src/components/feed/ShareModal.jsx requires supporting elements like tooltips, empty states, or inline coaching; design and implement them if absent so flows never dead-end.
23. Design Changes. Map src/components/feed/ShareModal.jsx to the refined information architecture, ensuring entry points, breadcrumbs, and contextual actions reflect the simplified mental model.
24. Design Duplication. Register src/components/feed/ShareModal.jsx in the design system catalogue with a canonical spec so teams stop forking the UI for similar needs.
25. Design framework. Publish component docs for src/components/feed/ShareModal.jsx covering props, data contracts, accessibility, theming, QA steps, and code samples inside Storybook/Chromatic.
26. Mobile App Functionality. Mirror src/components/feed/ShareModal.jsx's functionality in Flutter or native modules by exporting schema types, event contracts, and UI mocks to the mobile squad.

5.B.4 src/components/connections/SuggestedConnections.jsx — Expanded Component Blueprint
1. Appraisal. src/components/connections/SuggestedConnections.jsx sits on legacy scaffolding that tangles presentation and business concerns; capture an exhaustive inventory of props, context, and downstream consumers before the redesign begins so no path is missed.
2. Functionality. Audit every event handler inside src/components/connections/SuggestedConnections.jsx and document success, failure, and loading states; wire them to integration tests that simulate desktop, tablet, and mobile behaviours.
3. Logic Usefulness. Trace the logic stack for src/components/connections/SuggestedConnections.jsx from data request to render and challenge each conditional; if the logic does not deliver measurable user value or analytics insight, move it to backlog or delete it.
4. Redundancies. Compare src/components/connections/SuggestedConnections.jsx with sibling modules to remove duplicated utilities, nested wrappers, or styling fragments; publish a diff in the component registry before merging changes.
5. Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs. Replace any placeholder links, TODO blocks, or stub async functions in src/components/connections/SuggestedConnections.jsx with production-ready flows or delete them outright so the experience is never half-finished.
6. Duplicate Functions. Merge repeated helper functions in src/components/connections/SuggestedConnections.jsx into shared hooks and memoized selectors; annotate the removal in changelog entries so other squads can update imports.
7. Improvements need to make. Build a Figma-aligned implementation brief for src/components/connections/SuggestedConnections.jsx that includes acceptance criteria, telemetry goals, accessibility checklists, and rollout guardrails.
8. Styling improvements. Translate the high-fidelity tokens to src/components/connections/SuggestedConnections.jsx with explicit specs for spacing, typography, radii, and shadows; reject any variance greater than 1px or 1dp when doing visual QA.
9. Efficiency analysis and improvement. Profile src/components/connections/SuggestedConnections.jsx with React Profiler (or relevant tooling) to eliminate wasted renders, heavy bundles, and blocking network waterfalls; capture before-and-after metrics.
10. Strengths to Keep. Catalog the behaviours in src/components/connections/SuggestedConnections.jsx that users rely on—keyboard shortcuts, progressive disclosure, crisp copy—and lock them into regression tests so they are preserved during overhaul.
11. Weaknesses to remove. Identify every confusing micro-interaction, misaligned icon, or inconsistent layout within src/components/connections/SuggestedConnections.jsx and remove them during the redesign sprint; document the removals for stakeholder sign-off.
12. Styling and Colour review changes. Apply the approved navy-slate base palette and coral accents to src/components/connections/SuggestedConnections.jsx, validate contrast ratios, and add dark-mode tokens to the design tokens library.
13. Css, orientation, placement and arrangement changes. Recompose src/components/connections/SuggestedConnections.jsx using modern layout primitives (flex/grid/auto layout) with defined breakpoints for desktop, tablet, and mobile to keep orientation predictable.

1. Appraisal. src/pages/GroupProfilePage.jsx sits on legacy scaffolding that tangles presentation and business concerns; capture an exhaustive inventory of props, context, and downstream consumers before the redesign begins so no path is missed.
2. Functionality. Audit every event handler inside src/pages/GroupProfilePage.jsx and document success, failure, and loading states; wire them to integration tests that simulate desktop, tablet, and mobile behaviours.
3. Logic Usefulness. Trace the logic stack for src/pages/GroupProfilePage.jsx from data request to render and challenge each conditional; if the logic does not deliver measurable user value or analytics insight, move it to backlog or delete it.
4. Redundancies. Compare src/pages/GroupProfilePage.jsx with sibling modules to remove duplicated utilities, nested wrappers, or styling fragments; publish a diff in the component registry before merging changes.
5. Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs. Replace any placeholder links, TODO blocks, or stub async functions in src/pages/GroupProfilePage.jsx with production-ready flows or delete them outright so the experience is never half-finished.
6. Duplicate Functions. Merge repeated helper functions in src/pages/GroupProfilePage.jsx into shared hooks and memoized selectors; annotate the removal in changelog entries so other squads can update imports.
7. Improvements need to make. Build a Figma-aligned implementation brief for src/pages/GroupProfilePage.jsx that includes acceptance criteria, telemetry goals, accessibility checklists, and rollout guardrails.
8. Styling improvements. Translate the high-fidelity tokens to src/pages/GroupProfilePage.jsx with explicit specs for spacing, typography, radii, and shadows; reject any variance greater than 1px or 1dp when doing visual QA.
9. Efficiency analysis and improvement. Profile src/pages/GroupProfilePage.jsx with React Profiler (or relevant tooling) to eliminate wasted renders, heavy bundles, and blocking network waterfalls; capture before-and-after metrics.
10. Strengths to Keep. Catalog the behaviours in src/pages/GroupProfilePage.jsx that users rely on—keyboard shortcuts, progressive disclosure, crisp copy—and lock them into regression tests so they are preserved during overhaul.
11. Weaknesses to remove. Identify every confusing micro-interaction, misaligned icon, or inconsistent layout within src/pages/GroupProfilePage.jsx and remove them during the redesign sprint; document the removals for stakeholder sign-off.
12. Styling and Colour review changes. Apply the approved navy-slate base palette and coral accents to src/pages/GroupProfilePage.jsx, validate contrast ratios, and add dark-mode tokens to the design tokens library.
13. Css, orientation, placement and arrangement changes. Recompose src/pages/GroupProfilePage.jsx using modern layout primitives (flex/grid/auto layout) with defined breakpoints for desktop, tablet, and mobile to keep orientation predictable.
14. Text analysis, text placement, text length, text redundancy and quality of text analysis. Rewrite every string rendered by src/pages/GroupProfilePage.jsx so it is sharp, user-focused, and internationalization-ready; capture length budgets in the content guide.
15. Text Spacing. Implement typographic rhythm in src/pages/GroupProfilePage.jsx with 4/8/12px increments, consistent line-heights, and purposeful white space so dense data still breathes.
16. Shaping. Align corners, chips, and avatar cuts in src/pages/GroupProfilePage.jsx to the shared 8/12/16 radius matrix; include shape tokens for states like pressed or focused.
17. Shadow, hover, glow and effects. Limit src/pages/GroupProfilePage.jsx to brand-sanctioned elevations and transitions; codify hover, focus, and pressed states with measurable durations and easing curves.
18. Thumbnails. Audit any media or thumbnail surfaces inside src/pages/GroupProfilePage.jsx; enforce standardized aspect ratios, fallback illustrations, and lazy-loading placeholders.
19. Images and media & Images and media previews. Route all media requests in src/pages/GroupProfilePage.jsx through the optimized CDN pipeline with responsive sourcesets, skeleton states, and upload progress indicators.
20. Button styling. Enforce the slim 40-44px high button variants in src/pages/GroupProfilePage.jsx, with icon-leading, text-only, and destructive options backed by accessible focus outlines.
21. Interactiveness. Instrument src/pages/GroupProfilePage.jsx with keyboard navigation, screen-reader announcements, pointer and touch gestures, and micro-animations aligned to Material motion values.
22. Missing Components. Confirm whether src/pages/GroupProfilePage.jsx requires supporting elements like tooltips, empty states, or inline coaching; design and implement them if absent so flows never dead-end.
23. Design Changes. Map src/pages/GroupProfilePage.jsx to the refined information architecture, ensuring entry points, breadcrumbs, and contextual actions reflect the simplified mental model.
24. Design Duplication. Register src/pages/GroupProfilePage.jsx in the design system catalogue with a canonical spec so teams stop forking the UI for similar needs.
25. Design framework. Publish component docs for src/pages/GroupProfilePage.jsx covering props, data contracts, accessibility, theming, QA steps, and code samples inside Storybook/Chromatic.
26. Mobile App Functionality. Mirror src/pages/GroupProfilePage.jsx's functionality in Flutter or native modules by exporting schema types, event contracts, and UI mocks to the mobile squad.
27. Mobile App Styling. Deliver color, typography, and spacing tokens derived from src/pages/GroupProfilePage.jsx to the mobile theming pipeline so parity is preserved across devices.
28. Change Checklist Tracker Extensive. Track src/pages/GroupProfilePage.jsx's rebuild in the program board with tasks for design sign-off, unit tests, integration tests, localization, analytics, release notes, and playbook updates.
29. Full Upgrade Plan & Release Steps  Extensive. Run src/pages/GroupProfilePage.jsx through feature-flagged rollout: ship to internal alpha, capture metrics, fix defects, graduate to beta cohorts, prepare comms, then launch globally.

5.C.8 src/components/mentor/MentorFilters.jsx — Expanded Component Blueprint
1. Appraisal. src/components/mentor/MentorFilters.jsx sits on legacy scaffolding that tangles presentation and business concerns; capture an exhaustive inventory of props, context, and downstream consumers before the redesign begins so no path is missed.
2. Functionality. Audit every event handler inside src/components/mentor/MentorFilters.jsx and document success, failure, and loading states; wire them to integration tests that simulate desktop, tablet, and mobile behaviours.
3. Logic Usefulness. Trace the logic stack for src/components/mentor/MentorFilters.jsx from data request to render and challenge each conditional; if the logic does not deliver measurable user value or analytics insight, move it to backlog or delete it.
4. Redundancies. Compare src/components/mentor/MentorFilters.jsx with sibling modules to remove duplicated utilities, nested wrappers, or styling fragments; publish a diff in the component registry before merging changes.
5. Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs. Replace any placeholder links, TODO blocks, or stub async functions in src/components/mentor/MentorFilters.jsx with production-ready flows or delete them outright so the experience is never half-finished.
6. Duplicate Functions. Merge repeated helper functions in src/components/mentor/MentorFilters.jsx into shared hooks and memoized selectors; annotate the removal in changelog entries so other squads can update imports.
7. Improvements need to make. Build a Figma-aligned implementation brief for src/components/mentor/MentorFilters.jsx that includes acceptance criteria, telemetry goals, accessibility checklists, and rollout guardrails.
8. Styling improvements. Translate the high-fidelity tokens to src/components/mentor/MentorFilters.jsx with explicit specs for spacing, typography, radii, and shadows; reject any variance greater than 1px or 1dp when doing visual QA.
9. Efficiency analysis and improvement. Profile src/components/mentor/MentorFilters.jsx with React Profiler (or relevant tooling) to eliminate wasted renders, heavy bundles, and blocking network waterfalls; capture before-and-after metrics.
10. Strengths to Keep. Catalog the behaviours in src/components/mentor/MentorFilters.jsx that users rely on—keyboard shortcuts, progressive disclosure, crisp copy—and lock them into regression tests so they are preserved during overhaul.
11. Weaknesses to remove. Identify every confusing micro-interaction, misaligned icon, or inconsistent layout within src/components/mentor/MentorFilters.jsx and remove them during the redesign sprint; document the removals for stakeholder sign-off.

5.D.9 src/components/notifications/NotificationFilterBar.jsx — Expanded Component Blueprint
1. Appraisal. src/components/notifications/NotificationFilterBar.jsx sits on legacy scaffolding that tangles presentation and business concerns; capture an exhaustive inventory of props, context, and downstream consumers before the redesign begins so no path is missed.
2. Functionality. Audit every event handler inside src/components/notifications/NotificationFilterBar.jsx and document success, failure, and loading states; wire them to integration tests that simulate desktop, tablet, and mobile behaviours.
3. Logic Usefulness. Trace the logic stack for src/components/notifications/NotificationFilterBar.jsx from data request to render and challenge each conditional; if the logic does not deliver measurable user value or analytics insight, move it to backlog or delete it.
4. Redundancies. Compare src/components/notifications/NotificationFilterBar.jsx with sibling modules to remove duplicated utilities, nested wrappers, or styling fragments; publish a diff in the component registry before merging changes.
5. Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs. Replace any placeholder links, TODO blocks, or stub async functions in src/components/notifications/NotificationFilterBar.jsx with production-ready flows or delete them outright so the experience is never half-finished.
6. Duplicate Functions. Merge repeated helper functions in src/components/notifications/NotificationFilterBar.jsx into shared hooks and memoized selectors; annotate the removal in changelog entries so other squads can update imports.
7. Improvements need to make. Build a Figma-aligned implementation brief for src/components/notifications/NotificationFilterBar.jsx that includes acceptance criteria, telemetry goals, accessibility checklists, and rollout guardrails.
8. Styling improvements. Translate the high-fidelity tokens to src/components/notifications/NotificationFilterBar.jsx with explicit specs for spacing, typography, radii, and shadows; reject any variance greater than 1px or 1dp when doing visual QA.
9. Efficiency analysis and improvement. Profile src/components/notifications/NotificationFilterBar.jsx with React Profiler (or relevant tooling) to eliminate wasted renders, heavy bundles, and blocking network waterfalls; capture before-and-after metrics.
10. Strengths to Keep. Catalog the behaviours in src/components/notifications/NotificationFilterBar.jsx that users rely on—keyboard shortcuts, progressive disclosure, crisp copy—and lock them into regression tests so they are preserved during overhaul.
11. Weaknesses to remove. Identify every confusing micro-interaction, misaligned icon, or inconsistent layout within src/components/notifications/NotificationFilterBar.jsx and remove them during the redesign sprint; document the removals for stakeholder sign-off.
12. Styling and Colour review changes. Apply the approved navy-slate base palette and coral accents to src/components/notifications/NotificationFilterBar.jsx, validate contrast ratios, and add dark-mode tokens to the design tokens library.
13. Css, orientation, placement and arrangement changes. Recompose src/components/notifications/NotificationFilterBar.jsx using modern layout primitives (flex/grid/auto layout) with defined breakpoints for desktop, tablet, and mobile to keep orientation predictable.
14. Text analysis, text placement, text length, text redundancy and quality of text analysis. Rewrite every string rendered by src/components/notifications/NotificationFilterBar.jsx so it is sharp, user-focused, and internationalization-ready; capture length budgets in the content guide.
15. Text Spacing. Implement typographic rhythm in src/components/notifications/NotificationFilterBar.jsx with 4/8/12px increments, consistent line-heights, and purposeful white space so dense data still breathes.
16. Shaping. Align corners, chips, and avatar cuts in src/components/notifications/NotificationFilterBar.jsx to the shared 8/12/16 radius matrix; include shape tokens for states like pressed or focused.
17. Shadow, hover, glow and effects. Limit src/components/notifications/NotificationFilterBar.jsx to brand-sanctioned elevations and transitions; codify hover, focus, and pressed states with measurable durations and easing curves.
18. Thumbnails. Audit any media or thumbnail surfaces inside src/components/notifications/NotificationFilterBar.jsx; enforce standardized aspect ratios, fallback illustrations, and lazy-loading placeholders.
19. Images and media & Images and media previews. Route all media requests in src/components/notifications/NotificationFilterBar.jsx through the optimized CDN pipeline with responsive sourcesets, skeleton states, and upload progress indicators.

6.B.4 src/pages/ProjectAutoMatchPage.jsx — Expanded Component Blueprint
1. Appraisal. src/pages/ProjectAutoMatchPage.jsx sits on legacy scaffolding that tangles presentation and business concerns; capture an exhaustive inventory of props, context, and downstream consumers before the redesign begins so no path is missed.
2. Functionality. Audit every event handler inside src/pages/ProjectAutoMatchPage.jsx and document success, failure, and loading states; wire them to integration tests that simulate desktop, tablet, and mobile behaviours.
3. Logic Usefulness. Trace the logic stack for src/pages/ProjectAutoMatchPage.jsx from data request to render and challenge each conditional; if the logic does not deliver measurable user value or analytics insight, move it to backlog or delete it.
4. Redundancies. Compare src/pages/ProjectAutoMatchPage.jsx with sibling modules to remove duplicated utilities, nested wrappers, or styling fragments; publish a diff in the component registry before merging changes.
5. Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs. Replace any placeholder links, TODO blocks, or stub async functions in src/pages/ProjectAutoMatchPage.jsx with production-ready flows or delete them outright so the experience is never half-finished.
6. Duplicate Functions. Merge repeated helper functions in src/pages/ProjectAutoMatchPage.jsx into shared hooks and memoized selectors; annotate the removal in changelog entries so other squads can update imports.
7. Improvements need to make. Build a Figma-aligned implementation brief for src/pages/ProjectAutoMatchPage.jsx that includes acceptance criteria, telemetry goals, accessibility checklists, and rollout guardrails.
8. Styling improvements. Translate the high-fidelity tokens to src/pages/ProjectAutoMatchPage.jsx with explicit specs for spacing, typography, radii, and shadows; reject any variance greater than 1px or 1dp when doing visual QA.
9. Efficiency analysis and improvement. Profile src/pages/ProjectAutoMatchPage.jsx with React Profiler (or relevant tooling) to eliminate wasted renders, heavy bundles, and blocking network waterfalls; capture before-and-after metrics.
10. Strengths to Keep. Catalog the behaviours in src/pages/ProjectAutoMatchPage.jsx that users rely on—keyboard shortcuts, progressive disclosure, crisp copy—and lock them into regression tests so they are preserved during overhaul.
11. Weaknesses to remove. Identify every confusing micro-interaction, misaligned icon, or inconsistent layout within src/pages/ProjectAutoMatchPage.jsx and remove them during the redesign sprint; document the removals for stakeholder sign-off.
12. Styling and Colour review changes. Apply the approved navy-slate base palette and coral accents to src/pages/ProjectAutoMatchPage.jsx, validate contrast ratios, and add dark-mode tokens to the design tokens library.
13. Css, orientation, placement and arrangement changes. Recompose src/pages/ProjectAutoMatchPage.jsx using modern layout primitives (flex/grid/auto layout) with defined breakpoints for desktop, tablet, and mobile to keep orientation predictable.
14. Text analysis, text placement, text length, text redundancy and quality of text analysis. Rewrite every string rendered by src/pages/ProjectAutoMatchPage.jsx so it is sharp, user-focused, and internationalization-ready; capture length budgets in the content guide.
15. Text Spacing. Implement typographic rhythm in src/pages/ProjectAutoMatchPage.jsx with 4/8/12px increments, consistent line-heights, and purposeful white space so dense data still breathes.
16. Shaping. Align corners, chips, and avatar cuts in src/pages/ProjectAutoMatchPage.jsx to the shared 8/12/16 radius matrix; include shape tokens for states like pressed or focused.
17. Shadow, hover, glow and effects. Limit src/pages/ProjectAutoMatchPage.jsx to brand-sanctioned elevations and transitions; codify hover, focus, and pressed states with measurable durations and easing curves.
18. Thumbnails. Audit any media or thumbnail surfaces inside src/pages/ProjectAutoMatchPage.jsx; enforce standardized aspect ratios, fallback illustrations, and lazy-loading placeholders.
19. Images and media & Images and media previews. Route all media requests in src/pages/ProjectAutoMatchPage.jsx through the optimized CDN pipeline with responsive sourcesets, skeleton states, and upload progress indicators.
20. Button styling. Enforce the slim 40-44px high button variants in src/pages/ProjectAutoMatchPage.jsx, with icon-leading, text-only, and destructive options backed by accessible focus outlines.
21. Interactiveness. Instrument src/pages/ProjectAutoMatchPage.jsx with keyboard navigation, screen-reader announcements, pointer and touch gestures, and micro-animations aligned to Material motion values.
22. Missing Components. Confirm whether src/pages/ProjectAutoMatchPage.jsx requires supporting elements like tooltips, empty states, or inline coaching; design and implement them if absent so flows never dead-end.
23. Design Changes. Map src/pages/ProjectAutoMatchPage.jsx to the refined information architecture, ensuring entry points, breadcrumbs, and contextual actions reflect the simplified mental model.

11. Weaknesses to remove. Identify every confusing micro-interaction, misaligned icon, or inconsistent layout within src/components/projects/ProjectBudget.jsx and remove them during the redesign sprint; document the removals for stakeholder sign-off.
12. Styling and Colour review changes. Apply the approved navy-slate base palette and coral accents to src/components/projects/ProjectBudget.jsx, validate contrast ratios, and add dark-mode tokens to the design tokens library.
13. Css, orientation, placement and arrangement changes. Recompose src/components/projects/ProjectBudget.jsx using modern layout primitives (flex/grid/auto layout) with defined breakpoints for desktop, tablet, and mobile to keep orientation predictable.
14. Text analysis, text placement, text length, text redundancy and quality of text analysis. Rewrite every string rendered by src/components/projects/ProjectBudget.jsx so it is sharp, user-focused, and internationalization-ready; capture length budgets in the content guide.
15. Text Spacing. Implement typographic rhythm in src/components/projects/ProjectBudget.jsx with 4/8/12px increments, consistent line-heights, and purposeful white space so dense data still breathes.
16. Shaping. Align corners, chips, and avatar cuts in src/components/projects/ProjectBudget.jsx to the shared 8/12/16 radius matrix; include shape tokens for states like pressed or focused.
17. Shadow, hover, glow and effects. Limit src/components/projects/ProjectBudget.jsx to brand-sanctioned elevations and transitions; codify hover, focus, and pressed states with measurable durations and easing curves.
18. Thumbnails. Audit any media or thumbnail surfaces inside src/components/projects/ProjectBudget.jsx; enforce standardized aspect ratios, fallback illustrations, and lazy-loading placeholders.
19. Images and media & Images and media previews. Route all media requests in src/components/projects/ProjectBudget.jsx through the optimized CDN pipeline with responsive sourcesets, skeleton states, and upload progress indicators.
20. Button styling. Enforce the slim 40-44px high button variants in src/components/projects/ProjectBudget.jsx, with icon-leading, text-only, and destructive options backed by accessible focus outlines.
21. Interactiveness. Instrument src/components/projects/ProjectBudget.jsx with keyboard navigation, screen-reader announcements, pointer and touch gestures, and micro-animations aligned to Material motion values.
22. Missing Components. Confirm whether src/components/projects/ProjectBudget.jsx requires supporting elements like tooltips, empty states, or inline coaching; design and implement them if absent so flows never dead-end.
23. Design Changes. Map src/components/projects/ProjectBudget.jsx to the refined information architecture, ensuring entry points, breadcrumbs, and contextual actions reflect the simplified mental model.
24. Design Duplication. Register src/components/projects/ProjectBudget.jsx in the design system catalogue with a canonical spec so teams stop forking the UI for similar needs.

6.B.10 src/components/projectGigManagement/ProjectGigBoard.jsx — Expanded Component Blueprint
1. Appraisal. src/components/projectGigManagement/ProjectGigBoard.jsx sits on legacy scaffolding that tangles presentation and business concerns; capture an exhaustive inventory of props, context, and downstream consumers before the redesign begins so no path is missed.
2. Functionality. Audit every event handler inside src/components/projectGigManagement/ProjectGigBoard.jsx and document success, failure, and loading states; wire them to integration tests that simulate desktop, tablet, and mobile behaviours.
3. Logic Usefulness. Trace the logic stack for src/components/projectGigManagement/ProjectGigBoard.jsx from data request to render and challenge each conditional; if the logic does not deliver measurable user value or analytics insight, move it to backlog or delete it.
4. Redundancies. Compare src/components/projectGigManagement/ProjectGigBoard.jsx with sibling modules to remove duplicated utilities, nested wrappers, or styling fragments; publish a diff in the component registry before merging changes.
5. Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs. Replace any placeholder links, TODO blocks, or stub async functions in src/components/projectGigManagement/ProjectGigBoard.jsx with production-ready flows or delete them outright so the experience is never half-finished.
6. Duplicate Functions. Merge repeated helper functions in src/components/projectGigManagement/ProjectGigBoard.jsx into shared hooks and memoized selectors; annotate the removal in changelog entries so other squads can update imports.
7. Improvements need to make. Build a Figma-aligned implementation brief for src/components/projectGigManagement/ProjectGigBoard.jsx that includes acceptance criteria, telemetry goals, accessibility checklists, and rollout guardrails.
8. Styling improvements. Translate the high-fidelity tokens to src/components/projectGigManagement/ProjectGigBoard.jsx with explicit specs for spacing, typography, radii, and shadows; reject any variance greater than 1px or 1dp when doing visual QA.
9. Efficiency analysis and improvement. Profile src/components/projectGigManagement/ProjectGigBoard.jsx with React Profiler (or relevant tooling) to eliminate wasted renders, heavy bundles, and blocking network waterfalls; capture before-and-after metrics.

6.B.15 src/components/gigs/GigCard.jsx — Expanded Component Blueprint
1. Appraisal. src/components/gigs/GigCard.jsx sits on legacy scaffolding that tangles presentation and business concerns; capture an exhaustive inventory of props, context, and downstream consumers before the redesign begins so no path is missed.
2. Functionality. Audit every event handler inside src/components/gigs/GigCard.jsx and document success, failure, and loading states; wire them to integration tests that simulate desktop, tablet, and mobile behaviours.
3. Logic Usefulness. Trace the logic stack for src/components/gigs/GigCard.jsx from data request to render and challenge each conditional; if the logic does not deliver measurable user value or analytics insight, move it to backlog or delete it.
4. Redundancies. Compare src/components/gigs/GigCard.jsx with sibling modules to remove duplicated utilities, nested wrappers, or styling fragments; publish a diff in the component registry before merging changes.
5. Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs. Replace any placeholder links, TODO blocks, or stub async functions in src/components/gigs/GigCard.jsx with production-ready flows or delete them outright so the experience is never half-finished.
6. Duplicate Functions. Merge repeated helper functions in src/components/gigs/GigCard.jsx into shared hooks and memoized selectors; annotate the removal in changelog entries so other squads can update imports.
7. Improvements need to make. Build a Figma-aligned implementation brief for src/components/gigs/GigCard.jsx that includes acceptance criteria, telemetry goals, accessibility checklists, and rollout guardrails.
8. Styling improvements. Translate the high-fidelity tokens to src/components/gigs/GigCard.jsx with explicit specs for spacing, typography, radii, and shadows; reject any variance greater than 1px or 1dp when doing visual QA.
9. Efficiency analysis and improvement. Profile src/components/gigs/GigCard.jsx with React Profiler (or relevant tooling) to eliminate wasted renders, heavy bundles, and blocking network waterfalls; capture before-and-after metrics.
10. Strengths to Keep. Catalog the behaviours in src/components/gigs/GigCard.jsx that users rely on—keyboard shortcuts, progressive disclosure, crisp copy—and lock them into regression tests so they are preserved during overhaul.
11. Weaknesses to remove. Identify every confusing micro-interaction, misaligned icon, or inconsistent layout within src/components/gigs/GigCard.jsx and remove them during the redesign sprint; document the removals for stakeholder sign-off.
12. Styling and Colour review changes. Apply the approved navy-slate base palette and coral accents to src/components/gigs/GigCard.jsx, validate contrast ratios, and add dark-mode tokens to the design tokens library.
13. Css, orientation, placement and arrangement changes. Recompose src/components/gigs/GigCard.jsx using modern layout primitives (flex/grid/auto layout) with defined breakpoints for desktop, tablet, and mobile to keep orientation predictable.
14. Text analysis, text placement, text length, text redundancy and quality of text analysis. Rewrite every string rendered by src/components/gigs/GigCard.jsx so it is sharp, user-focused, and internationalization-ready; capture length budgets in the content guide.
15. Text Spacing. Implement typographic rhythm in src/components/gigs/GigCard.jsx with 4/8/12px increments, consistent line-heights, and purposeful white space so dense data still breathes.
16. Shaping. Align corners, chips, and avatar cuts in src/components/gigs/GigCard.jsx to the shared 8/12/16 radius matrix; include shape tokens for states like pressed or focused.
17. Shadow, hover, glow and effects. Limit src/components/gigs/GigCard.jsx to brand-sanctioned elevations and transitions; codify hover, focus, and pressed states with measurable durations and easing curves.
18. Thumbnails. Audit any media or thumbnail surfaces inside src/components/gigs/GigCard.jsx; enforce standardized aspect ratios, fallback illustrations, and lazy-loading placeholders.
19. Images and media & Images and media previews. Route all media requests in src/components/gigs/GigCard.jsx through the optimized CDN pipeline with responsive sourcesets, skeleton states, and upload progress indicators.

7.A.4 src/components/calendar/EventCard.jsx — Expanded Component Blueprint
1. Appraisal. src/components/calendar/EventCard.jsx sits on legacy scaffolding that tangles presentation and business concerns; capture an exhaustive inventory of props, context, and downstream consumers before the redesign begins so no path is missed.
2. Functionality. Audit every event handler inside src/components/calendar/EventCard.jsx and document success, failure, and loading states; wire them to integration tests that simulate desktop, tablet, and mobile behaviours.
3. Logic Usefulness. Trace the logic stack for src/components/calendar/EventCard.jsx from data request to render and challenge each conditional; if the logic does not deliver measurable user value or analytics insight, move it to backlog or delete it.
4. Redundancies. Compare src/components/calendar/EventCard.jsx with sibling modules to remove duplicated utilities, nested wrappers, or styling fragments; publish a diff in the component registry before merging changes.
5. Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs. Replace any placeholder links, TODO blocks, or stub async functions in src/components/calendar/EventCard.jsx with production-ready flows or delete them outright so the experience is never half-finished.
6. Duplicate Functions. Merge repeated helper functions in src/components/calendar/EventCard.jsx into shared hooks and memoized selectors; annotate the removal in changelog entries so other squads can update imports.
7. Improvements need to make. Build a Figma-aligned implementation brief for src/components/calendar/EventCard.jsx that includes acceptance criteria, telemetry goals, accessibility checklists, and rollout guardrails.
8. Styling improvements. Translate the high-fidelity tokens to src/components/calendar/EventCard.jsx with explicit specs for spacing, typography, radii, and shadows; reject any variance greater than 1px or 1dp when doing visual QA.
9. Efficiency analysis and improvement. Profile src/components/calendar/EventCard.jsx with React Profiler (or relevant tooling) to eliminate wasted renders, heavy bundles, and blocking network waterfalls; capture before-and-after metrics.
10. Strengths to Keep. Catalog the behaviours in src/components/calendar/EventCard.jsx that users rely on—keyboard shortcuts, progressive disclosure, crisp copy—and lock them into regression tests so they are preserved during overhaul.
11. Weaknesses to remove. Identify every confusing micro-interaction, misaligned icon, or inconsistent layout within src/components/calendar/EventCard.jsx and remove them during the redesign sprint; document the removals for stakeholder sign-off.
12. Styling and Colour review changes. Apply the approved navy-slate base palette and coral accents to src/components/calendar/EventCard.jsx, validate contrast ratios, and add dark-mode tokens to the design tokens library.
13. Css, orientation, placement and arrangement changes. Recompose src/components/calendar/EventCard.jsx using modern layout primitives (flex/grid/auto layout) with defined breakpoints for desktop, tablet, and mobile to keep orientation predictable.
14. Text analysis, text placement, text length, text redundancy and quality of text analysis. Rewrite every string rendered by src/components/calendar/EventCard.jsx so it is sharp, user-focused, and internationalization-ready; capture length budgets in the content guide.

8.B.2 src/components/security/SecurityChecklist.jsx — Expanded Component Blueprint
1. Appraisal. src/components/security/SecurityChecklist.jsx sits on legacy scaffolding that tangles presentation and business concerns; capture an exhaustive inventory of props, context, and downstream consumers before the redesign begins so no path is missed.
2. Functionality. Audit every event handler inside src/components/security/SecurityChecklist.jsx and document success, failure, and loading states; wire them to integration tests that simulate desktop, tablet, and mobile behaviours.
3. Logic Usefulness. Trace the logic stack for src/components/security/SecurityChecklist.jsx from data request to render and challenge each conditional; if the logic does not deliver measurable user value or analytics insight, move it to backlog or delete it.
4. Redundancies. Compare src/components/security/SecurityChecklist.jsx with sibling modules to remove duplicated utilities, nested wrappers, or styling fragments; publish a diff in the component registry before merging changes.
5. Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs. Replace any placeholder links, TODO blocks, or stub async functions in src/components/security/SecurityChecklist.jsx with production-ready flows or delete them outright so the experience is never half-finished.
6. Duplicate Functions. Merge repeated helper functions in src/components/security/SecurityChecklist.jsx into shared hooks and memoized selectors; annotate the removal in changelog entries so other squads can update imports.
7. Improvements need to make. Build a Figma-aligned implementation brief for src/components/security/SecurityChecklist.jsx that includes acceptance criteria, telemetry goals, accessibility checklists, and rollout guardrails.
8. Styling improvements. Translate the high-fidelity tokens to src/components/security/SecurityChecklist.jsx with explicit specs for spacing, typography, radii, and shadows; reject any variance greater than 1px or 1dp when doing visual QA.
9. Efficiency analysis and improvement. Profile src/components/security/SecurityChecklist.jsx with React Profiler (or relevant tooling) to eliminate wasted renders, heavy bundles, and blocking network waterfalls; capture before-and-after metrics.
10. Strengths to Keep. Catalog the behaviours in src/components/security/SecurityChecklist.jsx that users rely on—keyboard shortcuts, progressive disclosure, crisp copy—and lock them into regression tests so they are preserved during overhaul.
11. Weaknesses to remove. Identify every confusing micro-interaction, misaligned icon, or inconsistent layout within src/components/security/SecurityChecklist.jsx and remove them during the redesign sprint; document the removals for stakeholder sign-off.
12. Styling and Colour review changes. Apply the approved navy-slate base palette and coral accents to src/components/security/SecurityChecklist.jsx, validate contrast ratios, and add dark-mode tokens to the design tokens library.
13. Css, orientation, placement and arrangement changes. Recompose src/components/security/SecurityChecklist.jsx using modern layout primitives (flex/grid/auto layout) with defined breakpoints for desktop, tablet, and mobile to keep orientation predictable.
14. Text analysis, text placement, text length, text redundancy and quality of text analysis. Rewrite every string rendered by src/components/security/SecurityChecklist.jsx so it is sharp, user-focused, and internationalization-ready; capture length budgets in the content guide.
15. Text Spacing. Implement typographic rhythm in src/components/security/SecurityChecklist.jsx with 4/8/12px increments, consistent line-heights, and purposeful white space so dense data still breathes.
16. Shaping. Align corners, chips, and avatar cuts in src/components/security/SecurityChecklist.jsx to the shared 8/12/16 radius matrix; include shape tokens for states like pressed or focused.
17. Shadow, hover, glow and effects. Limit src/components/security/SecurityChecklist.jsx to brand-sanctioned elevations and transitions; codify hover, focus, and pressed states with measurable durations and easing curves.
18. Thumbnails. Audit any media or thumbnail surfaces inside src/components/security/SecurityChecklist.jsx; enforce standardized aspect ratios, fallback illustrations, and lazy-loading placeholders.

9.A.8 gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/* — Expanded Component Blueprint
1. Appraisal. gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/* sits on legacy scaffolding that tangles presentation and business concerns; capture an exhaustive inventory of props, context, and downstream consumers before the redesign begins so no path is missed.
2. Functionality. Audit every event handler inside gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/* and document success, failure, and loading states; wire them to integration tests that simulate desktop, tablet, and mobile behaviours.
3. Logic Usefulness. Trace the logic stack for gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/* from data request to render and challenge each conditional; if the logic does not deliver measurable user value or analytics insight, move it to backlog or delete it.
4. Redundancies. Compare gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/* with sibling modules to remove duplicated utilities, nested wrappers, or styling fragments; publish a diff in the component registry before merging changes.
5. Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs. Replace any placeholder links, TODO blocks, or stub async functions in gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/* with production-ready flows or delete them outright so the experience is never half-finished.
6. Duplicate Functions. Merge repeated helper functions in gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/* into shared hooks and memoized selectors; annotate the removal in changelog entries so other squads can update imports.
7. Improvements need to make. Build a Figma-aligned implementation brief for gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/* that includes acceptance criteria, telemetry goals, accessibility checklists, and rollout guardrails.
8. Styling improvements. Translate the high-fidelity tokens to gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/* with explicit specs for spacing, typography, radii, and shadows; reject any variance greater than 1px or 1dp when doing visual QA.
9. Efficiency analysis and improvement. Profile gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/* with React Profiler (or relevant tooling) to eliminate wasted renders, heavy bundles, and blocking network waterfalls; capture before-and-after metrics.
10. Strengths to Keep. Catalog the behaviours in gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/* that users rely on—keyboard shortcuts, progressive disclosure, crisp copy—and lock them into regression tests so they are preserved during overhaul.
11. Weaknesses to remove. Identify every confusing micro-interaction, misaligned icon, or inconsistent layout within gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/* and remove them during the redesign sprint; document the removals for stakeholder sign-off.

10.A.4 gigvora-backend-nodejs/package.json scripts — Expanded Component Blueprint
1. Appraisal. gigvora-backend-nodejs/package.json scripts sits on legacy scaffolding that tangles presentation and business concerns; capture an exhaustive inventory of props, context, and downstream consumers before the redesign begins so no path is missed.
2. Functionality. Audit every event handler inside gigvora-backend-nodejs/package.json scripts and document success, failure, and loading states; wire them to integration tests that simulate desktop, tablet, and mobile behaviours.
3. Logic Usefulness. Trace the logic stack for gigvora-backend-nodejs/package.json scripts from data request to render and challenge each conditional; if the logic does not deliver measurable user value or analytics insight, move it to backlog or delete it.
4. Redundancies. Compare gigvora-backend-nodejs/package.json scripts with sibling modules to remove duplicated utilities, nested wrappers, or styling fragments; publish a diff in the component registry before merging changes.
5. Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs. Replace any placeholder links, TODO blocks, or stub async functions in gigvora-backend-nodejs/package.json scripts with production-ready flows or delete them outright so the experience is never half-finished.
6. Duplicate Functions. Merge repeated helper functions in gigvora-backend-nodejs/package.json scripts into shared hooks and memoized selectors; annotate the removal in changelog entries so other squads can update imports.
7. Improvements need to make. Build a Figma-aligned implementation brief for gigvora-backend-nodejs/package.json scripts that includes acceptance criteria, telemetry goals, accessibility checklists, and rollout guardrails.
8. Styling improvements. Translate the high-fidelity tokens to gigvora-backend-nodejs/package.json scripts with explicit specs for spacing, typography, radii, and shadows; reject any variance greater than 1px or 1dp when doing visual QA.
9. Efficiency analysis and improvement. Profile gigvora-backend-nodejs/package.json scripts with React Profiler (or relevant tooling) to eliminate wasted renders, heavy bundles, and blocking network waterfalls; capture before-and-after metrics.
10. Strengths to Keep. Catalog the behaviours in gigvora-backend-nodejs/package.json scripts that users rely on—keyboard shortcuts, progressive disclosure, crisp copy—and lock them into regression tests so they are preserved during overhaul.
11. Weaknesses to remove. Identify every confusing micro-interaction, misaligned icon, or inconsistent layout within gigvora-backend-nodejs/package.json scripts and remove them during the redesign sprint; document the removals for stakeholder sign-off.
12. Styling and Colour review changes. Apply the approved navy-slate base palette and coral accents to gigvora-backend-nodejs/package.json scripts, validate contrast ratios, and add dark-mode tokens to the design tokens library.
13. Css, orientation, placement and arrangement changes. Recompose gigvora-backend-nodejs/package.json scripts using modern layout primitives (flex/grid/auto layout) with defined breakpoints for desktop, tablet, and mobile to keep orientation predictable.
14. Text analysis, text placement, text length, text redundancy and quality of text analysis. Rewrite every string rendered by gigvora-backend-nodejs/package.json scripts so it is sharp, user-focused, and internationalization-ready; capture length budgets in the content guide.
15. Text Spacing. Implement typographic rhythm in gigvora-backend-nodejs/package.json scripts with 4/8/12px increments, consistent line-heights, and purposeful white space so dense data still breathes.
16. Shaping. Align corners, chips, and avatar cuts in gigvora-backend-nodejs/package.json scripts to the shared 8/12/16 radius matrix; include shape tokens for states like pressed or focused.
17. Shadow, hover, glow and effects. Limit gigvora-backend-nodejs/package.json scripts to brand-sanctioned elevations and transitions; codify hover, focus, and pressed states with measurable durations and easing curves.
18. Thumbnails. Audit any media or thumbnail surfaces inside gigvora-backend-nodejs/package.json scripts; enforce standardized aspect ratios, fallback illustrations, and lazy-loading placeholders.
19. Images and media & Images and media previews. Route all media requests in gigvora-backend-nodejs/package.json scripts through the optimized CDN pipeline with responsive sourcesets, skeleton states, and upload progress indicators.
20. Button styling. Enforce the slim 40-44px high button variants in gigvora-backend-nodejs/package.json scripts, with icon-leading, text-only, and destructive options backed by accessible focus outlines.
21. Interactiveness. Instrument gigvora-backend-nodejs/package.json scripts with keyboard navigation, screen-reader announcements, pointer and touch gestures, and micro-animations aligned to Material motion values.

12.B.2 gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/index.css — Expanded Component Blueprint
1. Appraisal. gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/index.css sits on legacy scaffolding that tangles presentation and business concerns; capture an exhaustive inventory of props, context, and downstream consumers before the redesign begins so no path is missed.
2. Functionality. Audit every event handler inside gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/index.css and document success, failure, and loading states; wire them to integration tests that simulate desktop, tablet, and mobile behaviours.
3. Logic Usefulness. Trace the logic stack for gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/index.css from data request to render and challenge each conditional; if the logic does not deliver measurable user value or analytics insight, move it to backlog or delete it.
4. Redundancies. Compare gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/index.css with sibling modules to remove duplicated utilities, nested wrappers, or styling fragments; publish a diff in the component registry before merging changes.
5. Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs. Replace any placeholder links, TODO blocks, or stub async functions in gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/index.css with production-ready flows or delete them outright so the experience is never half-finished.
6. Duplicate Functions. Merge repeated helper functions in gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/index.css into shared hooks and memoized selectors; annotate the removal in changelog entries so other squads can update imports.
7. Improvements need to make. Build a Figma-aligned implementation brief for gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/index.css that includes acceptance criteria, telemetry goals, accessibility checklists, and rollout guardrails.
8. Styling improvements. Translate the high-fidelity tokens to gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/index.css with explicit specs for spacing, typography, radii, and shadows; reject any variance greater than 1px or 1dp when doing visual QA.
9. Efficiency analysis and improvement. Profile gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/index.css with React Profiler (or relevant tooling) to eliminate wasted renders, heavy bundles, and blocking network waterfalls; capture before-and-after metrics.
10. Strengths to Keep. Catalog the behaviours in gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/index.css that users rely on—keyboard shortcuts, progressive disclosure, crisp copy—and lock them into regression tests so they are preserved during overhaul.
11. Weaknesses to remove. Identify every confusing micro-interaction, misaligned icon, or inconsistent layout within gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/index.css and remove them during the redesign sprint; document the removals for stakeholder sign-off.
12. Styling and Colour review changes. Apply the approved navy-slate base palette and coral accents to gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/index.css, validate contrast ratios, and add dark-mode tokens to the design tokens library.
13. Css, orientation, placement and arrangement changes. Recompose gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/index.css using modern layout primitives (flex/grid/auto layout) with defined breakpoints for desktop, tablet, and mobile to keep orientation predictable.
14. Text analysis, text placement, text length, text redundancy and quality of text analysis. Rewrite every string rendered by gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/index.css so it is sharp, user-focused, and internationalization-ready; capture length budgets in the content guide.
15. Text Spacing. Implement typographic rhythm in gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/index.css with 4/8/12px increments, consistent line-heights, and purposeful white space so dense data still breathes.
16. Shaping. Align corners, chips, and avatar cuts in gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/index.css to the shared 8/12/16 radius matrix; include shape tokens for states like pressed or focused.
17. Shadow, hover, glow and effects. Limit gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/index.css to brand-sanctioned elevations and transitions; codify hover, focus, and pressed states with measurable durations and easing curves.
18. Thumbnails. Audit any media or thumbnail surfaces inside gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/index.css; enforce standardized aspect ratios, fallback illustrations, and lazy-loading placeholders.
19. Images and media & Images and media previews. Route all media requests in gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/index.css through the optimized CDN pipeline with responsive sourcesets, skeleton states, and upload progress indicators.
20. Button styling. Enforce the slim 40-44px high button variants in gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/index.css, with icon-leading, text-only, and destructive options backed by accessible focus outlines.
21. Interactiveness. Instrument gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/index.css with keyboard navigation, screen-reader announcements, pointer and touch gestures, and micro-animations aligned to Material motion values.
22. Missing Components. Confirm whether gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/index.css requires supporting elements like tooltips, empty states, or inline coaching; design and implement them if absent so flows never dead-end.
23. Design Changes. Map gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/index.css to the refined information architecture, ensuring entry points, breadcrumbs, and contextual actions reflect the simplified mental model.
24. Design Duplication. Register gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/index.css in the design system catalogue with a canonical spec so teams stop forking the UI for similar needs.
