14. **Text analysis, placement, length, redundancy, quality.** Text strategy for Suggested Connections & Signals establishes voice-and-tone guardrails, trims redundancy, and aligns microcopy with premium executive-network expectations. Bios, action prompts, and insight chips must stay under 80 characters while still conveying differentiated value, and copy variants are tested for clarity across web, mobile, and email surfaces. Editorial audits pair quantitative readability scoring with qualitative reviews from mentors, founders, and recruiters so that invitations, follow-up nudges, and insight tooltips remain aspirational, direct, and inclusive. Dynamic text sourcing references localized dictionaries and fallback messaging to avoid empty states, while CTA ordering prioritises the highest-impact action (connect, follow, invite) using analytic evidence.
   - *Persona Messaging.* Tailor bios, prompts, and headlines to mentor, founder, recruiter, and investor personas, validating relevance with research transcripts.
   - *Microcopy Inventory.* Catalogue every label, tooltip, and helper string in Suggested Connections & Signals, eliminating duplicate phrasing and aligning terminology with shared content guidelines.
   - *Editorial QA.* Run Hemingway/Flesch readability scans and bilingual reviews to guarantee concise copy that localizes cleanly without exceeding layout constraints.
   - *CTA Hierarchy.* Sequence connect/follow/share buttons based on behavioural analytics, ensuring primary CTAs appear first in DOM order with supportive text capped at one sentence.
   - *Empty & Error States.* Provide empathetic, solution-oriented messaging for zero-results, loading, and retry screens, including optional “improve my matches” prompts.
   - *Localization Pipeline.* Connect copy keys to translation files, define fallbacks, and flag culturally sensitive phrases requiring bespoke localisation.
   - *Data Integrity.* Ensure dynamic stats (mutual connections, shared interests) include numeric context words (“3 shared founders”) and automatically pluralize with ICU messages.
   - *Governance.* Establish editorial review cadence, changelog, and ownership for copy updates so experimentation never drifts from approved brand voice.
