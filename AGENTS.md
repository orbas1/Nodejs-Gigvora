1. Global Navigation & Shell
1.A. Header & Top Navigation ✅
   1. Consolidated the header structure into a three-zone layout with responsive flex behaviour so navigation, search, and actions breathe on large viewports while gracefully stacking on mobile. The gridless approach reduces horizontal crowding and keeps orientation consistent across breakpoints.
   2. Introduced a Headless UI-driven Insights flyout that combines navigation pulse metrics and trending destinations within an accessible popover, replacing always-on side rails to declutter the shell while surfacing the same intelligence on demand.
   3. Refined the marketing search experience with a centred pill control that expands under focus, supports keyboard submission, and resets gracefully after navigation, making global discovery more prominent without overwhelming the hero rail.
   4. Preserved authenticated role switching and primary navigation clusters alongside the logo, ensuring governance personas stay visible while the marketing mega menus remain within easy reach for unauthenticated visitors.
   5. Retained inbox previews, notifications, language selection, and creation shortcuts, aligning them inside a balanced action group with measured spacing so power workflows remain one click away without visual noise.
   6. Maintained analytics tracking for trending destinations through the insights flyout so navigation telemetry continues to register persona-aware engagement even after the UI consolidation.
   7. Applied translucent shell treatments, subtle gradients, and backdrop blur adjustments to reinforce a premium, LinkedIn-calibre aesthetic with restrained highlights rather than dense decorative blocks.
   8. Layered a mobile-first quick search dialog with curated trending deep links so small-screen users can instantly launch people, opportunity, and workspace discovery without diving into the mega menus.
   9. Instrumented global search submissions with persona-aware analytics and reset behaviour while echoing insights tracking inside the quick search drawer, ensuring navigation intelligence and query journeys stay observable across entry points.
   10. Rebuilt the authenticated navigation dock into a LinkedIn-style icon row that anchors Home, Network, Jobs, Projects, Messaging, Notifications, and Work with shared styling tokens while delegating previews to the inbox and alert popovers for consistency.
1.B. Footer & System Bars
1.C. Layout Containers
1.D. Toasts & Feedback

   1. Recast the three-zone header scaffolding with balanced flex gutters and a softened gradient halo so navigation anchors, search intelligence, and action rails breathe from mobile through ultra-wide monitors without crowding the hero canvas.
   2. Embedded a SearchSpotlight surface beneath the desktop search pill that reveals live trending destinations and recent queries inside a floating glassmorphism panel, complete with hover-to-pin behaviour so users can read details without losing focus.
   3. Captured every successful marketing search locally, deduplicated the history to the latest ten entries, and exposed them as "Search “term” again" chips with a Clear control so power users can replay discoveries instantly while staying in flow.
   4. Added an inline ⌘K keyboard hint to the search pill and wired a global Ctrl/⌘+K listener that launches the quick search dialog, giving the header a command palette feel that mirrors modern productivity suites.
   5. Upgraded the QuickSearchDialog with mirrored history chips, trending rails, and persona-aware analytics so the modal serves as a universal launcher on desktop and mobile while keeping telemetry intact.
   6. Normalised marketing menu trends and search-configured highlights into one curated feed that hydrates both the Insights flyout and spotlight suggestions, ensuring the same premium destinations surface no matter the entry point.
   7. Recorded trending link engagement into the new history pipeline so clicking a featured surface instantly seeds the recent-search inventory and keeps recommendations contextually relevant.
   8. Hardened search submission handling with trimmed queries, history persistence, and graceful resets so the input returns to a ready state after every navigation without losing analytics fidelity.
   9. Tuned focus, blur, and hover choreography around the search spotlight to eliminate flicker, providing act()-safe transitions in tests and accessible escape handling when users dismiss the experience.
   10. Maintained the inbox preview, notifications, language selector, and creation shortcuts in a slim action bar, spacing each control to align with the new search footprint while preserving single-click access for frequent workflows.
   11. Preserved the insights popover with updated styling tokens so persona pulse metrics and trending callouts inherit the refreshed translucency treatments introduced for the spotlight.
   12. Synced the mobile navigation drawer with the new search services, delivering identical trending intelligence and analytics wiring on small screens so the quick-launch experience feels identical to desktop.

5. Feed & Timeline
5.A. Feed & Timeline ✅
   1. Re-oriented the composer so post-type toggles sit directly above the textarea with emoji and media pickers embedded inside the field, halving the vertical footprint while keeping rich creation tools one tap away.
   2. Collapsed the ActivityFilters panel into a lightweight chip row with inline freshness, draft counts, and refresh controls so curating the feed feels immediate instead of modal.
   3. Retired the experimental timeline pulse card and highlight grid so updates lead the column, reducing above-the-fold noise and letting content breathe.
   4. Refined the identity rail with slimmer stat badges, real company and agency thumbnails, and modern interest chips so the left column mirrors premium network hubs.
   5. Reworked suggested connections into full-width profile rows with concise bios, pill metadata, and a responsive introduction button that no longer breaks the layout on smaller screens.
   6. Slimmed the insights rail callouts by trimming redundant copy and aligning action buttons, ensuring “Start introduction” and Explorer CTAs read naturally without crowding.
   7. Updated avatar fallbacks to realistic pravatar headshots, keeping the timeline grounded in human imagery when members have not uploaded a profile photo.
   8. Smoothed the feed shell with a tidier two-row header that separates logo/search/actions from navigation chips, preventing the top bar from feeling congested even on dense workstations.

   6. Added resilient avatar utilities that hash collaborator seeds into gradient swatches, preserve initials, and work gracefully with owner fallbacks, matching the polish of networks like LinkedIn.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/agency/clientKanban/utils.js†L1-L78】

   10. Tuned drag-and-drop and creation flows to respect filtered views so moving or adding work never breaks ordering when the board is focused on a single client persona.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/agency/clientKanban/ClientKanbanBoard.jsx†L431-L590】
