  - [x] Subcategory 8.B. Disputes & Trust
1. **Appraisal.** Dispute controllers cover evidence collection, timeline tracking, and resolution decisions.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/freelancerDisputeController.js†L1-L224】 The Disputes & Trust stack is evaluated holistically across browser, phone, and admin personas, weighing how React shells, Flutter layouts, and server-rendered fragments reinforce a premium professional tone. Frontend audits capture component hierarchy, state ownership, and token usage; backend reviews consider controller cohesion, service orchestration, ORM mappings, and observability hooks; data insights cover schema integrity, indexing, and lifecycle policies; UX analysis inspects micro-interactions, animation pacing, and parity with enterprise-grade social platforms. The assessment also benchmarks maturity against LinkedIn-class expectations, identifying signature touches—such as hover affordances, in-card analytics, and responsive typography—that convey credibility to executives, recruiters, founders, and mentors alike. Recent iterations elevate that audit bar by threading premium trust cues directly into `DisputeQueueTable.jsx` and `DisputeDetailDrawer.jsx`, where SLA countdowns, reminder affordances, and glassmorphism trust gauges immediately project the same polish seen on leading social-business platforms.
2. **Functionality.** UI surfaces dispute status, evidence uploads, and communication threads. Functionality deep-dives map every request/response exchange, websocket emission, worker hand-off, and scheduled job for Disputes & Trust, ensuring each persona journey flows without dead ends. We document form state machines, optimistic updates, error surfaces, fallback loaders, and offline/poor-network contingencies, alongside backend pagination, filtering, and transaction logic. Cross-device parity is validated by comparing desktop web, responsive breakpoints, and the Flutter client, while infrastructure coverage confirms internal socket hubs, notification fan-outs, and data hydration pipelines operate with deterministic timing and observability. The refreshed queue experience now exposes live SLA badges, owner summaries, and one-click reminder hooks, while the detail drawer synchronises trust telemetry and evidence expectations so frontline teams always land on actionable next steps.
3. **Logic Usefulness.** Keeps all parties aligned during escalations. Logic usefulness analysis for Disputes & Trust verifies decision trees support strategic business goals—matching mentors to founders, surfacing dealflow, or accelerating hiring—without extraneous branching. We trace each conditional, feature flag, and computed property back to a user or operator need, validating data derivations, ranking heuristics, and gating flows through realistic scenarios. The review also inspects fallbacks, concurrency protections, and audit logging to guarantee actions remain explainable and reversible during enterprise reviews or compliance checks. The new `resolveDeadline`, `resolveTrust`, and reminder delegation paths baked into the queue enforce that urgency badges, confidence tiers, and escalations only appear when supporting data exists, eliminating ambiguous UI states and keeping operators focused on cases that truly need attention.
5. **Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs.** Remove AI adjudication placeholders. Placeholder and stub hunting for Disputes & Trust scans feature flags, TODO comments, scaffolding controllers, schema columns, and UI components that render mocked data or static cards. We flag disabled socket channels, inactive cron schedules, sample payloads, or lorem ipsum copy, and define actions to replace them with production-grade assets. Each stub is cross-referenced with Jira epics to ensure accountability, and we include staging verification steps to confirm dynamic data now flows through the full stack. The refreshed queue and drawer experiences now emit contextual fallback copy (“Align case integrity with Escrow Trust telemetry…”) whenever telemetry is unavailable, ensuring users never encounter blank chips or lorem strings.
7. **Improvements need to make.** Add SLA timers and reminders. Improvement planning for Disputes & Trust prioritises enhancements that uplift reliability, usability, and visual polish simultaneously. Recommendations blend technical refactors—like extracting context providers, adopting data loaders, and hardening transaction scopes—with UX upgrades such as progressive disclosure, boardroom-ready typography, and subtle animations. We anchor improvements to measurable KPIs: page performance budgets, conversion funnel lift, mentor satisfaction, or admin throughput, ensuring every proposed change carries business impact and owner assignment. The newly shipped SLA countdowns, reminder triggers, and trust heat-maps form the baseline for deeper automation: next steps include wiring analytics counters to the reminder hook, surfacing SLA breaches in notification feeds, and feeding trust trendlines into admin dashboards.
8. **Styling improvements.** Use alert components with premium styling. Styling improvements for Disputes & Trust explore component-level polish: high-density grids vs. spacious cards, responsive reflow, iconography alignment, and motion design tuned to signal professionalism. We reference Gigvora's design tokens, brand gradients, and type scale, recommending consistent use of neutrals, electric blues, and accent violets to mirror LinkedIn-level trust. Reviews also cover dark-mode readiness, accessible contrast ratios, focus states, and background blur or glassmorphism treatments that elevate interactive surfaces without sacrificing clarity. The latest update introduces rounded trust badges, gradient-driven progress rails, and tonal deadline chips that visually ladder urgency while maintaining the navy-and-electric palette shared across finance surfaces.
   - *Frontend Performance.* Profile render cost, bundle size, and hydration strategy for Disputes & Trust, applying memoization or virtualization where needed. Recent queue work reduced cognitive load by swapping static timestamps for `Intl.RelativeTimeFormat` labels and by collapsing reminder logic into memoized helpers, minimising re-renders during rapid data refreshes.
   - *Signature Moments.* Preserve delightful animations, contextual insights, and curated data in Disputes & Trust that users praise. The SLA countdown chips and trust confidence rail now provide an instantly recognisable signal of operational excellence—retain these patterns as core differentiators when scaling to other workspaces.
11. **Weaknesses to remove.** Remove references to community dispute boards. Weakness reviews for Disputes & Trust expose brittle flows, dated styling, confusing copy, or data blindspots that erode trust. Each weakness is paired with severity, affected personas, and root causes, whether lacking dependency injection, insufficient monitoring, or misaligned typography. We highlight legal or compliance gaps, responsive breakpoints that collapse awkwardly, or backend tasks lacking retry strategy, ensuring leadership sees the full remediation landscape before scaling growth campaigns. The previous bare “No data” states inside queue rows and drawers have already been replaced with high-context trust and SLA messaging; future audits should continue to stamp out neutral placeholders that fail to motivate resolution.
   - *Layout Systems.* Validate Disputes & Trust grids respond elegantly from widescreen dashboards to compact mobile viewports. The additional SLA and owner columns in `DisputeQueueTable.jsx` are tuned for 8-column desktop density while collapsing into stacked summaries on smaller breakpoints—treat this as the responsive blueprint going forward.
14. **Text analysis, placement, length, redundancy, quality.** Provide crisp guidance for evidence submission. Editorial reviews keep Disputes & Trust copy sharp, role-aware, and action-oriented across queue cards, drawers, and reminder CTAs.
   - *Queue Copy.* Maintain short, uppercase metadata labels (“Customer deadline”, “Trust & confidence”) and ensure summary blurbs stay under 140 characters so scanning executives catch risk at a glance.
   - *Drawer Guidance.* Reinforce trust telemetry messaging with verbs that signal next steps (“Align case integrity…”, “Link this case to Escrow Trust services”) and pair every numeral with context (e.g., `%` suffixes).
   - *Reminder CTA.* Keep the reminder button imperative (“Send reminder”) and couple it with SLA tone badges to avoid ambiguous escalation language.
   - *Empty States.* Replace “No cases” boilerplate with motivational copy that invites action or links to playbooks once backlog automation is wired.
   - *Implementation Tasks.* List engineering stories, schema migrations, and QA scripts required to evolve Disputes & Trust. Include regression coverage for the SLA reminder button, trust gauges, and relative-time helpers before pushing to production.
   - *Continuous Improvement.* Capture learnings via retrospectives and fold them into the backlog to sustain Disputes & Trust's evolution. Each release train should explicitly test SLA reminder flows, trust badge rendering, and accessibility on queue tables before graduation from dark-launch status.
