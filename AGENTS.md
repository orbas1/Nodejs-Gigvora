  - [x] Subcategory 3.C. Suggested Connections & Signals
14. **Text analysis, placement, length, redundancy, quality.** Text strategy for Suggested Connections & Signals establishes voice-and-tone guardrails, trims redundancy, and aligns microcopy with premium executive-network expectations. Bios, action prompts, and insight chips must stay under 80 characters while still conveying differentiated value, and copy variants are tested for clarity across web, mobile, and email surfaces. Editorial audits pair quantitative readability scoring with qualitative reviews from mentors, founders, and recruiters so that invitations, follow-up nudges, and insight tooltips remain aspirational, direct, and inclusive. Dynamic text sourcing references localized dictionaries and fallback messaging to avoid empty states, while CTA ordering prioritises the highest-impact action (connect, follow, invite) using analytic evidence.
   - *Persona Messaging.* Tailor bios, prompts, and headlines to mentor, founder, recruiter, and investor personas, validating relevance with research transcripts.
   - *Microcopy Inventory.* Catalogue every label, tooltip, and helper string in Suggested Connections & Signals, eliminating duplicate phrasing and aligning terminology with shared content guidelines.
   - *Editorial QA.* Run Hemingway/Flesch readability scans and bilingual reviews to guarantee concise copy that localizes cleanly without exceeding layout constraints.
   - *CTA Hierarchy.* Sequence connect/follow/share buttons based on behavioural analytics, ensuring primary CTAs appear first in DOM order with supportive text capped at one sentence.
   - *Empty & Error States.* Provide empathetic, solution-oriented messaging for zero-results, loading, and retry screens, including optional “improve my matches” prompts.
   - *Localization Pipeline.* Connect copy keys to translation files, define fallbacks, and flag culturally sensitive phrases requiring bespoke localisation.
   - *Data Integrity.* Ensure dynamic stats (mutual connections, shared interests) include numeric context words (“3 shared founders”) and automatically pluralize with ICU messages.
   - *Governance.* Establish editorial review cadence, changelog, and ownership for copy updates so experimentation never drifts from approved brand voice.

   - *Mobile Reach.* Mirror the reaction picker inside the Flutter client, matching the `REACTION_OPTIONS` taxonomy and ensuring touch affordances feel native.
   - *Moderation Hooks.* Extend existing analytics events (`web_feed_reaction_click`, `web_feed_comment_submit`) with admin context so trust-and-safety teams can trace abuse escalations.
   - *Reply Enhancements.* Provide smart reply templates per persona (mentor, founder, recruiter) and expose inline edit for recently posted comments to reduce churn.
   - *Observability.* Dashboards should chart palette usage, comment-to-reaction ratios, and failure counts from `reactToFeedPost` to prove business outcomes.
8. **Styling improvements.** Reaction controls lean on glassy capsules, tinted badges, and pill summaries to rival LinkedIn polish. Continue evolving the systemised aesthetic while safeguarding accessibility.
   - *Palette Governance.* Document the dot colors used in `REACTION_OPTIONS` (sky, amber, emerald, violet, rose) and link them to design tokens so other squads reuse the same emotion spectrum.
   - *Menu Motion.* Apply a 180–220 ms ease when the picker opens; subtle drop shadows and staggered icon fades reinforce premium craft.
   - *Summary Badge.* Keep the appreciation chip (`px-3 py-1`, rounded-full) anchored near actions, switching to a stacked layout below 640 px for readability.
   - *Emoji & GIF Popovers.* Align tray headers, dividers, and focus states with the reaction picker to deliver one cohesive popover language.
9. **Efficiency analysis and improvement.** `handleReactionChange` batches deactivate/activate calls with `Promise.all`, but we must still profile the full pipeline to avoid saturation during peak events.
   - *Network Hygiene.* Instrument latency on `/feed/:id/reactions` and retry throttled calls with exponential backoff so optimistic UI stays trustworthy.
   - *Render Budgets.* Use React Profiler to confirm the picker and summary chips re-render only when `reactionSummary` changes; memoise where necessary.
   - *Pagination.* Ensure `listFeedComments` respects cancellation (already using `AbortController`) and audit thread virtualization for 100+ replies.
   - *Analytics Sampling.* Buffer reaction events client-side to ship in micro-batches, balancing fidelity with network overhead.
   - *Stress Scenarios.* Simulate mentors toggling reactions rapidly to validate `setActiveReaction` never produces negative counts.
10. **Strengths to Keep.** Preserve the empathetic, fast UI moments that already delight power users.
   - *Optimistic Loops.* Keep instant comment/reply insertion with graceful rollback so conversations feel live even on flaky networks.
   - *Quick Replies.* Maintain the curated `QUICK_REPLY_SUGGESTIONS` strings; they spark thoughtful engagement without sounding robotic.
   - *Accessible Palette.* Retain keyboard/touch parity for the reaction picker (`aria-expanded`, escape handling) and keep the summary badge announcing updates with `aria-live`.
   - *Moderation Safeguards.* Continue running payloads through `moderateFeedComposerPayload` so spam never leaks into the feed.
11. **Weaknesses to remove.** Close gaps that still risk credibility or responsiveness.
   - *Offline Grace.* Provide queued reactions/comments when the device drops offline, flushing once connectivity returns.
   - *Error Surfaces.* Surface toasts when reaction sync fails instead of silent console warnings, giving members confidence their intent landed.
   - *Long Threads.* Introduce “Show more replies” pagination to avoid vertical fatigue on heavily engaged posts.
   - *Persona Tone.* Audit quick replies and placeholder copy so they stay relevant for founders, mentors, and talent partners alike.
   - *Analytics Drift.* Verify backend aggregators treat `support` vs `love` aliases identically to avoid mis-reporting sentiments.
12. **Styling and Colour review changes.** Calibrate the new appreciation spectrum with brand guidelines.
   - *Contrast Audits.* Test each dot/background pair in light and dark themes to exceed WCAG 2.2 AA for text and iconography.
   - *Hover States.* Define lighter tint variations for palette buttons when hovered/focused so visual feedback feels intentional.
   - *Badge Typography.* Use semibold 0.7 rem uppercase text in summary chips, matching other feed metrics for visual harmony.
   - *Export Modes.* Ensure screenshots or PDFs preserve the gradient and blur treatments applied to reaction controls for investor decks.
   - *Iconography.* Keep heroicons at 16–20 px inside 24–28 px pills for crisp retina rendering.
13. **CSS, orientation, placement and arrangement changes.** Reaction controls now combine a capsule button, chevron trigger, and appreciation badge; layout rules must scale across breakpoints.
   - *Flex Behaviour.* Keep the action row as a wrapping flex container so reactions, comments, and share buttons reflow on narrow screens.
   - *Hit Targets.* Maintain 40 px minimum hit zones for palette toggles and ensure focus outlines are visible against tinted backgrounds.
   - *Menu Placement.* Clamp the picker within the viewport by flipping it above the button when close to the bottom of the screen.
   - *RTL Support.* Mirror icon order and badge alignment when the interface runs right-to-left, avoiding overlap with the summary chip.
   - *Responsive Summary.* Collapse the appreciation badge beneath the action row below 480 px to protect copy legibility.
14. **Text analysis, placement, length, redundancy, quality.** Reaction microcopy emphasises appreciation and celebration language instead of casual slang.
   - *Palette Labels.* Keep verbs aspirational—“Appreciate”, “Celebrate”, “Support”, “Insightful”, “Curious”—so executives feel respected.
   - *Summary Copy.* Use “appreciation(s)” in the badge to reinforce positive culture while staying concise.
   - *Comment Prompts.* Retain prompts like “Join the conversation” and “Offer context, signal interest…” to encourage thoughtful, multi-sentence replies.
   - *Error Messaging.* Align comment/reaction errors with supportive tone (“We could not load the latest conversation. Please try again soon.”).
15. **Change Checklist Tracker.** Palette rollout requires tight coordination across product, design, engineering, and enablement.
   - *Design Sign-off.* Capture final swatches, iconography, and motion specs in Figma before development.
   - *Analytics Wiring.* Update event schemas and dashboards to track reaction-type adoption and comment depth after release.
   - *QA Matrix.* Test keyboard navigation, screen reader announcements, and touch gestures on major browsers/devices.

   - *Documentation.* Refresh runbooks detailing `reactToFeedPost` usage, optimistic update expectations, and rollback procedures.
   - *Launch Plan.* Stage via feature flag—internal dogfood → mentor beta → full network—while monitoring error rates and sentiment mix.
16. **Full Upgrade Plan & Release Steps.** Roll out multi-reaction analytics, moderation hooks, and mobile parity in a staged program: discovery → dual-track build → comprehensive QA → telemetry-backed launch. Maintain rollback scripts and guardrails so reactions remain trustworthy during peak hiring pushes.
   - *ShareModal Journeys.* Ensure internal vs. external sharing toggles wire into analytics, link-tracking, and governance workflows across desktop, mobile, and email follow-ups.【F:user_experience.md†L3749-L3844】
   - *Taxonomy Parity.* Keep reaction enumerations and payload schemas consistent between `FeedPage.jsx`, backend controllers, Sequelize models, and historical migrations to avoid enum drift when releasing new engagement signals.
5. **Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs.** Reaction taxonomy now ships fully across frontend, controllers, models, migrations, and demo seeders; any deprecated options must be retired end-to-end rather than hidden behind TODOs. Placeholder and stub hunting for Reactions & Comments scans feature flags, TODO comments, scaffolding controllers, schema columns, and UI components that render mocked data or static cards. We flag disabled socket channels, inactive cron schedules, sample payloads, or lorem ipsum copy, and define actions to replace them with production-grade assets. Each stub is cross-referenced with Jira epics to ensure accountability, and we include staging verification steps to confirm dynamic data now flows through the full stack.
  - [x] Subcategory 1.D. Shared Contracts & Validation
  - [x] Subcategory 2.B. Authorization & RBAC
1. **Appraisal.** Authorization & RBAC stitches backend policy enforcement with admin and mobile governance experiences. Express middleware normalises memberships, roles, and user types before protected controllers execute, ensuring every request carries consistent persona context.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/middleware/authorization.js†L1-L268】 RBAC controllers expose matrix, audit-log, and simulation endpoints while recording audit trails for compliance-grade traceability.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/rbacPolicyController.js†L1-L356】 React hooks aggregate memberships, roles, and permissions to gate navigation and feature affordances, auto-selecting the active membership when users satisfy policy requirements.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/hooks/useAuthorization.js†L1-L172】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/hooks/useRoleAccess.js†L1-L92】 Admin surfaces render persona guardrails, resources, and review cadences, and the Flutter client mirrors the same matrix so operations staff receive parity across devices.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/RbacMatrixPanel.jsx†L1-L220】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/application/rbac_matrix_provider.dart†L8-L24】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/presentation/rbac_matrix_card.dart†L8-L188】 Appraisal work compares these experiences against LinkedIn- and Workday-class benchmarks to guarantee the Gigvora stack feels trustworthy to executives, recruiters, and mentors.
   - *Security & Compliance.* Audit logging persists persona, resource, and constraint context to `RbacPolicyAuditEvent`, supporting SOC2 evidence and regulator-ready exports.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L360-L406】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/rbacPolicyAuditEvent.js†L1-L49】
   - *Accessibility.* Evaluate keyboard focus, aria semantics, and colour contrast across `RbacMatrixPanel` and the Flutter card to uphold WCAG 2.2 AA, especially for badge chips and hover-only affordances.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/RbacMatrixPanel.jsx†L176-L220】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/presentation/rbac_matrix_card.dart†L118-L188】
   - *Competitive Benchmark.* Compare guardrail storytelling, simulation UX, and audit transparency with LinkedIn Talent Insights, Workday Security, and Atlassian Cloud governance modules to target differentiation.
   - *Future Readiness.* `RBAC_MATRIX` currently covers platform, security, compliance, and operations personas; expansion to recruiter, mentor, and finance personas must be assessed for scale and review cadence updates.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L5-L233】
   - *Frontend Surface.* Validate skeleton, empty, and error states in `RbacMatrixPanel` and Flutter card so governance leaders always see polished transitions, even during refresh or outage scenarios.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/RbacMatrixPanel.jsx†L128-L220】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/presentation/rbac_matrix_card.dart†L20-L188】
   - *Backend Foundation.* Review controller dependency order, validation guards, and audit helpers to confirm policy simulations remain deterministic under load and traceable during incident response.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/rbacPolicyController.js†L230-L356】
   - *Data & Analytics.* Ensure audit events feed downstream insights—`findAndCountAll` pagination, search filters, and metadata snapshots must map cleanly into governance dashboards without drift.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L360-L420】
   - *UX & Brand.* Benchmark badge styling, typography, and microcopy (“RBAC guardrails & access matrix”) against premium professional networks to maintain credibility and warmth.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/RbacMatrixPanel.jsx†L176-L220】
2. **Functionality.** Middleware-level checks (`requireMembership`, `requireUserType`, `requireProjectManagementRole`) block unauthorised access before controllers evaluate persona context, while controllers serve matrix snapshots, filtered audit logs, and policy simulations backed by shared services.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/middleware/authorization.js†L52-L268】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/rbacPolicyController.js†L252-L352】 The admin React service client normalises query params, enforces identifier validation, and posts simulations, ensuring consistent API consumption from the UI layer.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/services/rbac.js†L1-L175】 React hooks compute membership sets, highlight missing roles, and auto-update the active membership when access is granted; Flutter providers short-circuit when the session lacks privileged memberships, keeping mobile parity tight.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/hooks/useRoleAccess.js†L29-L92】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/application/rbac_matrix_provider.dart†L8-L24】 Functionality reviews trace these flows end-to-end, from authenticated request headers through audit persistence and UI refresh states.
   - *Service Contracts.* Document `GET /admin/governance/rbac/matrix`, `GET /admin/governance/rbac/audit-events`, and `POST /admin/governance/rbac/simulate`, aligning controller responses with the `fetchRbacMatrix`, `fetchRbacAuditEvents`, and `simulateRbacDecision` contracts.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/rbacPolicyController.js†L252-L352】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/services/rbac.js†L136-L169】
   - *State Persistence.* Verify that React hooks keep session state current—`useRoleAccess` writes the selected membership via `updateSession`, and `useAuthorization` retains role/permission sets for downstream components.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/hooks/useRoleAccess.js†L29-L92】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/hooks/useAuthorization.js†L78-L168】
   - *Notifications.* Catalogue current audit logging and identify where policy denials should trigger internal notifications; today the stack records events but does not fan out alerts, leaving an opportunity for governance paging hooks.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L360-L406】
   - *Lifecycle Hooks.* Respect matrix review cadence (`reviewCadenceDays`) and UI calculations for the next review date, ensuring policy refresh reminders stay accurate across clients.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L5-L233】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/RbacMatrixPanel.jsx†L146-L174】
   - *User Journeys.* Map admin journeys from dashboard entry (DataStatus loading, error retry) through persona drilldowns and simulation flows, including Flutter empty states when access is missing.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/RbacMatrixPanel.jsx†L128-L220】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/presentation/rbac_matrix_card.dart†L20-L188】
   - *System Integrations.* Confirm `apiClient` usage inherits auth headers and retry semantics so RBAC endpoints align with broader admin networking patterns.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/services/rbac.js†L1-L175】
   - *Edge Conditions.* Exercise persona switching, expired sessions, and membership drops—controllers rely on `resolvePersonaKey` and permission maps, while Flutter providers currently return `null` when roles are absent, surfacing empty UI states.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/rbacPolicyController.js†L121-L219】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/application/rbac_matrix_provider.dart†L8-L24】
   - *Cross-Platform.* Align web and Flutter guardrail chips, review cadences, and empty/error copy so operations leaders trust the experience across devices.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/RbacMatrixPanel.jsx†L176-L220】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/presentation/rbac_matrix_card.dart†L20-L188】
3. **Logic Usefulness.** `evaluateAccess` centralises decision logic, normalising persona, resource, and action values before resolving allow/deny outcomes with constraint metadata, while controllers translate those evaluations into audit entries and HTTP responses.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L245-L348】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/rbacPolicyController.js†L311-L352】 Persona resolution is role- and permission-aware, expanding privileged coverage when governance permissions are present; audit helpers capture actor context for explainability.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/rbacPolicyController.js†L102-L219】 Logic reviews ensure these branches continue to support high-stakes scenarios—incident response, compliance exports, mentor programme governance—without introducing arbitrary friction.
   - *Personalisation.* Verify `resolveAllowedPersonas` and session-derived role sets adapt surfaces based on memberships and scopes, keeping experiences relevant to admins vs. operations leads.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/rbacPolicyController.js†L102-L152】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/hooks/useAuthorization.js†L78-L168】
   - *Conflict Resolution.* Ensure request role collectors deduplicate headers/body inputs and audit logging gracefully handles write failures via logger fallbacks.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/middleware/authorization.js†L132-L198】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L360-L406】
   - *Scenario Coverage.* Simulate high-volume audits and rapid persona switching to confirm `listPolicyAuditEvents` pagination and `resolvePersonaKey` logic maintain deterministic outcomes.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L360-L420】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/rbacPolicyController.js†L174-L256】
   - *Data Provenance.* Preserve source-of-truth indicators—policy key, resource key, constraints—in both API responses and stored events for regulator audits.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/rbacPolicyController.js†L252-L352】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/rbacPolicyAuditEvent.js†L1-L49】
   - *Decision Trees.* Document persona-to-resource grants from the static matrix and ensure UI surfaces (React & Flutter) expose rationale for allowed/denied actions.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L5-L233】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/RbacMatrixPanel.jsx†L69-L120】
   - *Business Alignment.* Tie grants back to product outcomes—runtime telemetry for platform admins, consent publishing for compliance managers, maintenance scheduling for operations leads.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L10-L233】
   - *Observability.* Maintain audit logging on every matrix/audit/simulation call so security officers can trace decisions quickly during incidents.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/rbacPolicyController.js†L252-L352】
   - *Recovery Paths.* Define fallbacks for unknown personas or missing grants—current logic returns explicit deny reasons (`unknown-persona`, `no-matching-grant`) that UI layers should surface with guidance.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L290-L348】
4. **Redundancies.** Duplicated role constants (`PROJECT_MANAGEMENT_ROLES`) live in middleware and React hooks, increasing drift risk when roles change.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/middleware/authorization.js†L105-L198】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/hooks/useAuthorization.js†L4-L156】 Similar normalisation helpers appear across middleware, controllers, and services, and persona-to-role mappings are hard-coded in multiple layers. Consolidating these into shared utilities or shared-contract exports prevents subtle inconsistencies across web, API, and mobile clients.
   - *Role Constants.* Extract shared role/persona enumerations to a contract consumed by middleware, hooks, and mobile providers.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/rbacPolicyController.js†L10-L115】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/application/rbac_matrix_provider.dart†L8-L24】
   - *Normalisation Helpers.* Deduplicate string normalisers across middleware and services to reduce maintenance overhead.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/middleware/authorization.js†L3-L50】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L236-L260】
   - *UI Grants.* `RbacMatrixPanel` slices the first three grants, and Flutter mirrors a subset—promote shared presentation utilities to avoid divergent truncation rules.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/RbacMatrixPanel.jsx†L94-L99】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/presentation/rbac_matrix_card.dart†L127-L188】
   - *Audit Helpers.* The audit helper inside the controller replicates request context extraction logic already available in other utilities; centralisation keeps instrumentation consistent.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/rbacPolicyController.js†L214-L352】
5. **Placeholders or non-working functions or stubs.** Some governance affordances still behave like placeholders. UI panels intentionally truncate persona grants (`slice(0, 3)`), hiding the majority of policies until expanded designs ship, and Flutter renders a generic empty-state message rather than role-specific guidance.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/RbacMatrixPanel.jsx†L94-L120】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/presentation/rbac_matrix_card.dart†L100-L188】 The audit model defines a `'challenge'` decision state, yet services only persist allow/deny, leaving the escalation path unimplemented.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/rbacPolicyAuditEvent.js†L1-L33】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L360-L406】 Cataloguing these gaps lets us replace them with production experiences before enterprise rollouts.
   - *UI Completion.* Expand web and mobile panels to render full grant lists with pagination or drill-ins so administrators are not blocked by preview-only cards.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/RbacMatrixPanel.jsx†L94-L120】
   - *Decision States.* Either implement or retire the `'challenge'` audit state so data exports stay internally consistent.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/rbacPolicyAuditEvent.js†L1-L33】
   - *Empty-state Guidance.* Update Flutter empty-state copy to explain how to request privileged memberships instead of signalling a passive future update.【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/presentation/rbac_matrix_card.dart†L100-L188】
   - *Documentation Sync.* Ensure governance runbooks reflect the live personas and resources enumerated in `RBAC_MATRIX` rather than placeholder scopes.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L5-L233】
6. **Duplicate Functions.** Beyond role arrays, string normalisation and persona resolution logic repeat across services, middleware, and controllers. Consolidating these functions avoids divergent behaviour when new persona keys or resource identifiers are introduced.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/middleware/authorization.js†L3-L50】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/rbacPolicyController.js†L63-L196】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L236-L348】 Shared helpers should also power Flutter providers to prevent mobile drift.
   - *Normalisers.* Promote a single normalise utility for roles, memberships, and personas that web, backend, and mobile can import.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/middleware/authorization.js†L3-L132】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/application/rbac_matrix_provider.dart†L8-L24】
   - *Persona Mapping.* Align `ROLE_TO_PERSONA` logic with Flutter’s accessible role set to avoid mismatched eligibility checks.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/rbacPolicyController.js†L10-L152】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/application/rbac_matrix_provider.dart†L8-L24】
   - *Audit Writers.* Collapse controller-level audit helpers and service-level event writers into a shared module with retry semantics so every policy decision uses identical instrumentation.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/rbacPolicyController.js†L214-L352】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L360-L406】
7. **Improvements need to make.** Introduce policy analytics that highlight denials by persona, resource, and action, allowing admins to spot friction quickly. Expand the static matrix to include recruiter, mentor, finance, and volunteer personas with clear guardrails while maintaining compliance-grade audit depth.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L5-L233】 Build shared constants for roles/personas, hydrate them into React hooks and Flutter providers, and surface progressive disclosure for full grant lists on the web panel. Add health indicators for audit-log latency and simulation throughput so SRE teams can detect regressions before customers notice.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/RbacMatrixPanel.jsx†L201-L220】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L360-L420】
8. **Styling improvements.** The admin panel already leans into glassmorphism and premium badges, but hover transitions and focus outlines should be standardised across grant chips and guardrail cards. Elevate empty/error states with illustrated treatments that match the enterprise tone on LinkedIn-scale products, and mirror those visuals in Flutter with Material 3 theming tokens.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/RbacMatrixPanel.jsx†L20-L120】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/presentation/rbac_matrix_card.dart†L14-L188】 Leverage shared design tokens so audit metrics, guardrails, and resource cards share typography hierarchy, accent gradients, and elevation scales.
9. **Efficiency analysis and improvement.** `getPolicyMatrix` clones the full matrix on every request, and `listPolicyAuditEvents` executes full `findAndCountAll` queries even for narrow slices, so caching and precomputed aggregates will reduce overhead as the matrix grows.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L236-L420】 React panels refetch the matrix on refresh without caching, and Flutter reruns the provider after every authentication change; memoising responses and adding conditional revalidation will keep admin experiences snappy.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/RbacMatrixPanel.jsx†L128-L220】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/application/rbac_matrix_provider.dart†L8-L24】
10. **Strengths to Keep.** Central evaluation logic and audit persistence already provide enterprise-grade explainability, while React hooks automatically align active memberships with granted roles so users glide into eligible workspaces.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L236-L348】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/hooks/useRoleAccess.js†L29-L92】 Cross-platform parity—web panel plus Flutter card—means operations leaders stay informed wherever they work, and the static matrix captures guardrails, resources, and review cadences in one authoritative source.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L5-L233】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/presentation/rbac_matrix_card.dart†L20-L188】
11. **Weaknesses to remove.** Persona coverage remains skewed toward internal operations; product, recruiter, and mentor personas still rely on legacy access paths. React and backend role constants drift independently, risking inconsistent gating. Audit exports lack challenge/appeal outcomes despite the model supporting them. Addressing these gaps elevates trust for enterprise buyers who expect complete governance visibility.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L5-L233】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/rbacPolicyAuditEvent.js†L1-L33】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/hooks/useAuthorization.js†L4-L156】
12. **Styling and Colour review changes.** Align admin badges (emerald, slate, rose palettes) with the broader brand system, introducing role-specific accents (e.g., security amber, compliance navy) and ensuring dark-mode equivalents exist. Reinforce focus-visible outlines on guardrail cards and ensure Flutter chips adopt Material colour harmonisation for accessibility.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/RbacMatrixPanel.jsx†L13-L120】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/presentation/rbac_matrix_card.dart†L118-L188】
13. **CSS, orientation, placement and arrangement changes.** Refine grid breakpoints so the matrix summary, persona cards, and guardrail lists remain legible on narrow admin viewports; today the panel uses a four-column grid on desktop and stack layouts on mobile, but we should validate large-screen density and RTL support.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/RbacMatrixPanel.jsx†L103-L220】 Flutter layouts should likewise confirm landscape/tablet experiences keep guardrail metrics above the fold.【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/presentation/rbac_matrix_card.dart†L118-L188】
14. **Text analysis, placement, length, redundancy, quality.** Review microcopy such as “RBAC guardrails & access matrix” (web) and “Guardrail catalogue not yet published” (Flutter) to ensure tone stays authoritative yet reassuring. Introduce persona-aware helper text that explains why access is limited and how to request upgrades, replacing generic placeholders.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/RbacMatrixPanel.jsx†L176-L220】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/presentation/rbac_matrix_card.dart†L100-L188】
15. **Change Checklist Tracker.** Sequence RBAC enhancements: align `RBAC_MATRIX` updates with shared-contract exports, regenerate API clients, expand web/mobile UI, and extend integration tests that hit matrix, audit, and simulation endpoints.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L5-L420】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/services/rbac.js†L136-L175】 Include security review, privacy impact assessment, and support training before rollout, and wire telemetry to monitor denials per persona plus API latency post-release.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/rbacPolicyController.js†L252-L352】
16. **Full Upgrade Plan & Release Steps.** Phase work through discovery (persona gap analysis, policy workshop), build (shared constants, controller updates, UI expansion), validation (unit + integration tests, accessibility audits, load testing on audit endpoints), and launch (feature-flag the new matrix, monitor audit volumes, collect governance feedback). Tie each phase to rollback criteria so we can revert to the previous matrix if telemetry or compliance checks fail.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/rbacPolicyController.js†L252-L352】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/RbacMatrixPanel.jsx†L201-L220】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L5-L420】
  - [ ] Subcategory 2.B. Authorization & RBAC
1. **Appraisal.** RBAC policies enforce granular permissions across calendar, finance, messaging, admin, and mentorship features using `rbacPolicyService` and `middleware/authorization`.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/middleware/authorization.js†L1-L189】 The Authorization & RBAC stack is evaluated holistically across browser, phone, and admin personas, weighing how React shells, Flutter layouts, and server-rendered fragments reinforce a premium professional tone. Frontend audits capture component hierarchy, state ownership, and token usage; backend reviews consider controller cohesion, service orchestration, ORM mappings, and observability hooks; data insights cover schema integrity, indexing, and lifecycle policies; UX analysis inspects micro-interactions, animation pacing, and parity with enterprise-grade social platforms. The assessment also benchmarks maturity against LinkedIn-class expectations, identifying signature touches—such as hover affordances, in-card analytics, and responsive typography—that convey credibility to executives, recruiters, founders, and mentors alike.
   - *Security & Compliance.* Check Authorization & RBAC for adherence to SOC2 guardrails, encryption policies, and audit logging expectations demanded by enterprise partners.
   - *Accessibility.* Validate keyboard navigation, ARIA labelling, and screen reader order in Authorization & RBAC align with WCAG 2.2 AA.
   - *Competitive Benchmark.* Compare Authorization & RBAC metrics and features to LinkedIn, AngelList, and other executive platforms to prioritise differentiators.
   - *Future Readiness.* Evaluate how Authorization & RBAC accommodates roadmap expansions like deeper mentor tiers, enhanced analytics overlays, or expanded executive services without re-architecture.
   - *Frontend Surface.* Audit how Authorization & RBAC components mount within `AppLayout`, verifying skeleton loaders, route transitions, and viewport breakpoints deliver seamless entry states regardless of device size.
   - *Backend Foundation.* Review service initialisation order, dependency injection boundaries, and resilience patterns (circuit breakers, retries) that keep Authorization & RBAC endpoints predictable under load spikes.
   - *Data & Analytics.* Trace entity lineage through Sequelize models, migrations, and warehouse exports to ensure Authorization & RBAC aggregates power downstream insights without drift.
   - *UX & Brand.* Compare animation curves, iconography, and grid density against executive-network competitors to guarantee Authorization & RBAC feels polished, modern, and trustworthy.
2. **Functionality.** Frontend gating hooks check session roles before exposing navigation, with fallback tooltips guiding upgrades.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/hooks/useRoleGate.js†L1-L82】 Functionality deep-dives map every request/response exchange, websocket emission, worker hand-off, and scheduled job for Authorization & RBAC, ensuring each persona journey flows without dead ends. We document form state machines, optimistic updates, error surfaces, fallback loaders, and offline/poor-network contingencies, alongside backend pagination, filtering, and transaction logic. Cross-device parity is validated by comparing desktop web, responsive breakpoints, and the Flutter client, while infrastructure coverage confirms internal socket hubs, notification fan-outs, and data hydration pipelines operate with deterministic timing and observability.
   - *Service Contracts.* Document request/response schemas, expected status codes, and error envelopes for Authorization & RBAC endpoints.
   - *State Persistence.* Confirm Authorization & RBAC persists drafts, filters, and preferences across sessions using secure storage.
   - *Notifications.* Trace how Authorization & RBAC triggers in-app, email, and push notifications, ensuring deduplication across channels.
   - *Lifecycle Hooks.* Audit cron jobs, data refresh windows, and retention rules that sustain Authorization & RBAC's freshness.
   - *User Journeys.* Document every entry point into Authorization & RBAC, from deep-link navigation to contextual modals, capturing validation, error recovery, and success confirmation states.
   - *System Integrations.* Enumerate internal API calls, socket topics, and worker queues triggered by Authorization & RBAC, highlighting sequencing and dependency contracts.
   - *Edge Conditions.* Simulate throttled networks, large payloads, permission changes, and session expiry to confirm Authorization & RBAC degrades gracefully.
   - *Cross-Platform.* Align behaviour between web React views and Flutter screens, including gesture patterns, offline caching, and haptic feedback.
3. **Logic Usefulness.** Policy evaluation occurs centrally, reducing duplication and enabling dynamic policy updates. Logic usefulness analysis for Authorization & RBAC verifies decision trees support strategic business goals—matching mentors to founders, surfacing dealflow, or accelerating hiring—without extraneous branching. We trace each conditional, feature flag, and computed property back to a user or operator need, validating data derivations, ranking heuristics, and gating flows through realistic scenarios. The review also inspects fallbacks, concurrency protections, and audit logging to guarantee actions remain explainable and reversible during enterprise reviews or compliance checks.
   - *Personalisation.* Assess algorithms tailoring Authorization & RBAC output based on role, intent, and behaviour, guaranteeing fairness and transparency.
   - *Conflict Resolution.* Inspect concurrency guards preventing double submissions or race conditions within Authorization & RBAC.
   - *Scenario Coverage.* Run tabletop exercises for extreme cases (e.g., high-volume hiring campaigns) to confirm Authorization & RBAC scales logically.
   - *Data Provenance.* Verify Authorization & RBAC surfaces source-of-truth indicators so executives trust displayed metrics.
   - *Decision Trees.* Map conditional flows, feature flags, and gating logic that determine visibility of Authorization & RBAC modules for each persona.
   - *Business Alignment.* Validate that scoring models, prioritisation, and nudges in Authorization & RBAC directly advance mentor matching, hiring velocity, or founder growth.
   - *Observability.* Ensure logs, metrics, and distributed traces explain why Authorization & RBAC made each decision for audit readiness.
   - *Recovery Paths.* Check fallback logic for missing data, upstream outages, or conflicting updates so Authorization & RBAC maintains continuity.
4. **Redundancies.** Multiple role constants defined across pages; centralise in `constants/roles.js`. Redundancy sweeps examine Authorization & RBAC across repositories, identifying overlapping components, duplicated reducers, redundant SQL joins, or parallel worker jobs that can be unified. We compare React hooks, backend services, and internal documentation for repeated logic, evaluate whether shared utilities can absorb divergence, and check if design tokens or typography scales are defined multiple times. Each potential redundancy is profiled for performance cost, maintenance risk, and alignment with internal coding standards, then ranked for consolidation priority.
   - *Dependency Graph.* Visualise libraries and packages Authorization & RBAC relies on, spotting overlapping utilities or polyfills.
   - *Documentation.* Consolidate wiki pages and runbooks to avoid conflicting Authorization & RBAC guidance for support teams.
   - *Design Tokens.* Remove duplicate hex codes or spacing constants referenced in Authorization & RBAC's SCSS/Tailwind layers.

   - *Data & Analytics.* Trace the shared `updateJobEngagementMetrics` helper feeding job metadata and the snapshot queries that now rely on `sequelizeClient.fn/col` for consistent aggregation even in stubbed environments.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/agencyJobModels.js†L218-L279】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/agencyJobManagementService.js†L496-L514】
2. **Functionality.** The refreshed models layer now auto-builds resilient slugs, timestamps publish transitions, sanitises tags and emails, and re-computes application/favourite metrics after every CRUD action, collapsing previously manual reconciliations into a single helper flow.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/agencyJobModels.js†L315-L379】 Service endpoints lean on `distinct` pagination, workspace-aware fallbacks for candidate names and interview schedules, and `sequelizeClient` aggregations so reporting APIs emit accurate counts even when Jest swaps in stubs.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/agencyJobManagementService.js†L64-L444】 End-to-end exercises confirm these hooks hydrate metadata immediately, propagate to job snapshots, and uphold optimistic UI patterns across desktop, responsive web, and Flutter clients without introducing dead ends.
   - *Lifecycle Hooks.* Capture the `ensurePublishedTimestamp` safeguards, engagement refreshes on create/update/destroy, and tests proving metadata integrity to ensure freshness budgets stay premium.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/agencyJobModels.js†L329-L379】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/tests/models/agencyModels.test.js†L197-L269】
   - *Edge Conditions.* Simulate duplicate tag payloads, mixed-case emails, and repeated metrics updates—the new sanitisation and merge logic keeps payloads idempotent without leaking duplicates.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/agencyJobModels.js†L194-L215】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/tests/models/agencyModels.test.js†L197-L265】
3. **Logic Usefulness.** Centralised engagement metrics now sit beside job metadata, letting controllers and analytics surfaces query application counts, favourites, and last-touch timestamps without bespoke joins while keeping lineage obvious.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/agencyJobModels.js†L218-L279】 Logic reviews verify the new `updateApplication` and `updateInterview` fallbacks preserve candidate names and schedules so downstream automation—like reminders and dashboards—continues to act on authoritative data.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/agencyJobManagementService.js†L340-L444】 Each conditional remains traceable to personas (recruiters, hiring managers, execs), with observability hooks capturing when and why metrics change to support audit trails.
   - *Data Provenance.* Highlight metadata snapshots enriched by hooks and validated through integration tests, giving executives ISO-stamped interaction history for every role.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/agencyJobModels.js†L248-L268】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/tests/models/agencyModels.test.js†L209-L265】
4. **Redundancies.** Tag arrays and slug generation now run through shared normalisers so duplicate casing, whitespace, or title collisions no longer spawn shadow records across workspaces.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/agencyJobModels.js†L194-L338】 Redundancy sweeps continue across repositories to collapse overlapping reducers, SQL joins, or worker jobs, ensuring design tokens and analytics remain canonical while schema bloat is pruned deliberately.
   - *Design Tokens.* Keep metrics JSON co-located in metadata so UI layers ingest a single payload rather than duplicating spacing or analytics constants.
5. **Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs.** Engagement counters once mocked in analytics have been replaced with live metadata persisted via `updateJobEngagementMetrics`, and Jest now exercises real slugs, publish windows, and metrics to keep placeholder fixtures out of premium experiences.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/agencyJobModels.js†L218-L279】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/tests/models/agencyModels.test.js†L197-L269】 Remaining stub hunts continue to sweep feature flags, scaffold controllers, and static JSON so production datasets stay authoritative.
6. **Duplicate Functions.** A single `updateJobEngagementMetrics` helper now drives application, favourite, and response recalculations, removing bespoke counters sprinkled across services and consolidating analytics in one canonical path.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/agencyJobModels.js†L218-L279】 Ongoing sweeps still watch for redundant scopes, service calls, or UI formatters so polymorphic strategies, shared contracts, or configuration-driven patterns prevent drift.
9. **Efficiency analysis and improvement.** Slug normalisation, metadata hooks, and `findAndCountAll` queries now run with deduplicated tag arrays and `distinct` pagination to prevent ballooning row counts while keeping analytics precise.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/agencyJobModels.js†L194-L340】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/agencyJobManagementService.js†L64-L122】 Efficiency reviews still target covering indexes, worker throughput, queue pressure, and caching so executive workflows stay snappy across web and mobile.
   - *Backend Performance.* Track the impact of metadata recomputation, `distinct` pagination, and `sequelizeClient` aggregations on SQL plans so analytics stay real-time without duplicating effort.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/agencyJobManagementService.js†L64-L514】
10. **Strengths to Keep.** Rich associations now feed first-class engagement metrics and publish windows, letting dashboards display recruiter-friendly analytics without bespoke joins while preserving lean controller logic.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/agencyJobModels.js†L218-L344】 Strength inventories celebrate these reusable hooks, metadata payloads, and upgraded reporting surfaces so future iterations amplify what users already love.
11. **Weaknesses to remove.** Prior tag, email, and count drift has been addressed through normalisers and shared helpers; remaining weaknesses focus on retiring unused columns, replacing legacy search triggers, and monitoring for new regressions so executive trust stays intact.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/agencyJobModels.js†L194-L338】 Reviews still call out brittle flows, accessibility gaps, or monitoring blind spots with severity-driven action plans before scaling campaigns.
1. **Appraisal.** The job marketplace domain now produces workspace-scoped slugs, normalised hiring manager contacts, and live engagement metrics directly within `AgencyJob` metadata via tightly-scoped Sequelize hooks, giving dashboards LinkedIn-grade instrumentation without sacrificing schema clarity.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/agencyJobModels.js†L28-L344】 Schema alignment is locked in with database-level ENUMs, workspace+slug uniqueness, and compensation safeguards so migrations, models, and API payloads speak the same language across environments.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/database/migrations/20241022101500-agency-job-management.cjs†L29-L125】 A flagship marketplace seeder now hydrates the tables with production-style jobs, applications, interviews, responses, and favourites so executive demos mirror live hiring programs and surface premium overlays on web and mobile surfaces.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/database/seeders/20250322093000-agency-job-marketplace-demo.cjs†L1-L209】 Reviews continue across browser, phone, and admin clients to confirm these database enrichments surface as polished overlays, with audits spanning component hierarchy, state ownership, ORM ergonomics, and lifecycle guardrails. Competitive benchmarking highlights the richer analytics, deterministic publish windows, and resilient slug governance as the premium differentiators that keep Gigvora’s data layer aligned with LinkedIn- and Instagram-tier expectations.
2. **Functionality.** The refreshed models layer now auto-builds resilient slugs, timestamps publish transitions, sanitises tags and emails, and re-computes application/favourite metrics after every CRUD action, collapsing previously manual reconciliations into a single helper flow.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/agencyJobModels.js†L315-L379】 Real currency enumerations, workspace trimming, and metadata merging ensure payloads stay production-ready even under retry storms, while validation at the service layer rejects rogue compensation currencies before they hit persistence.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/agencyJobModels.js†L36-L215】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/agencyJobManagementService.js†L33-L513】 The marketplace seeder exercises every relation—jobs, applications, interviews, favourites, responses—so staging and analytics dashboards render authentic metrics from day one.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/database/seeders/20250322093000-agency-job-marketplace-demo.cjs†L89-L209】 End-to-end exercises confirm these hooks hydrate metadata immediately, propagate to job snapshots, and uphold optimistic UI patterns across desktop, responsive web, and Flutter clients without introducing dead ends.
3. **Logic Usefulness.** Centralised engagement metrics now sit beside job metadata, letting controllers and analytics surfaces query application counts, favourites, and last-touch timestamps without bespoke joins while keeping lineage obvious.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/agencyJobModels.js†L218-L279】 Logic reviews verify the new `updateApplication` and `updateInterview` fallbacks preserve candidate names and schedules so downstream automation—like reminders and dashboards—continues to act on authoritative data, while metadata responses now expose the currency catalogue for client apps without extra joins.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/agencyJobManagementService.js†L252-L513】 The seeder’s realistic narratives and timestamps give product, analytics, and QA squads a reliable baseline for stress testing high-volume campaigns, ensuring executive personas experience accurate engagement rollups out of the box.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/database/seeders/20250322093000-agency-job-marketplace-demo.cjs†L89-L209】 Each conditional remains traceable to personas (recruiters, hiring managers, execs), with observability hooks capturing when and why metrics change to support audit trails.
5. **Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs.** Engagement counters once mocked in analytics have been replaced with live metadata persisted via `updateJobEngagementMetrics`, and Jest now exercises real slugs, publish windows, and metrics to keep placeholder fixtures out of premium experiences.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/agencyJobModels.js†L218-L379】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/tests/models/agencyModels.test.js†L197-L269】 Seed data now ships with executive-ready payloads across every related table, eliminating lorem ipsum demo gaps and giving sales, success, and QA teams authentic journeys to reference during reviews.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/database/seeders/20250322093000-agency-job-marketplace-demo.cjs†L1-L209】 Remaining stub hunts continue to sweep feature flags, scaffold controllers, and static JSON so production datasets stay authoritative.

- [x] Subcategory 1.A. Frontend Shell & Routing
1. **Appraisal.** The React entry (`src/main.jsx`, `src/App.jsx`) bootstraps routing, suspense loaders, and persona-aware layouts that wrap every page in shared navigation and session context, while the unified `ProtectedRoute` boundary now owns every secure shell hand-off so dashboards, settings, and mobile breakpoints inherit a consistent access posture.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/main.jsx†L1-L48】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/App.jsx†L63-L140】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/routing/ProtectedRoute.jsx†L1-L152】 The Frontend Shell & Routing stack is evaluated holistically across browser, phone, and admin personas, weighing how React shells, Flutter layouts, and server-rendered fragments reinforce a premium professional tone. Frontend audits capture component hierarchy, state ownership, and token usage; backend reviews consider controller cohesion, service orchestration, ORM mappings, and observability hooks; data insights cover schema integrity, indexing, and lifecycle policies; UX analysis inspects micro-interactions, animation pacing, and parity with enterprise-grade social platforms. The assessment also benchmarks maturity against LinkedIn-class expectations, identifying signature touches—such as hover affordances, in-card analytics, and responsive typography—that convey credibility to executives, recruiters, founders, and mentors alike.
2. **Functionality.** `react-router-dom` routes map dashboards, feed, explorer, finance hub, mentorship, groups, admin tools, and support utilities through guarded wrappers that verify authentication and membership before rendering, with every membership or role check funnelling through the shared `ProtectedRoute` interface consumed by the marketing shell, dashboard gates, and targeted role requirements.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/App.jsx†L63-L140】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/routing/ProtectedRoute.jsx†L71-L152】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/auth/MembershipGate.jsx†L135-L152】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/auth/ProtectedDashboardRoute.jsx†L1-L19】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/auth/RequireDashboardAccess.jsx†L42-L63】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/auth/RequireMembership.jsx†L67-L95】 Functionality deep-dives map every request/response exchange, websocket emission, worker hand-off, and scheduled job for Frontend Shell & Routing, ensuring each persona journey flows without dead ends. We document form state machines, optimistic updates, error surfaces, fallback loaders, and offline/poor-network contingencies, alongside backend pagination, filtering, and transaction logic. Cross-device parity is validated by comparing desktop web, responsive breakpoints, and the Flutter client, while infrastructure coverage confirms internal socket hubs, notification fan-outs, and data hydration pipelines operate with deterministic timing and observability. Route metadata remains canonical across the stack because the shared contracts feed both the web router and the Sequelize-backed registry synchroniser, eliminating drift between client bundles, migrations, and seeders.【F:shared-contracts/domain/platform/route-registry.js†L601-L651】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/routeRegistryService.js†L1-L136】
3. **Logic Usefulness.** Suspense fallbacks and lazy loading isolate heavy routes, improving initial paint while keeping session hydration synchronous through `useSession` and `SessionProvider` hooks.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/context/SessionContext.jsx†L1-L176】 Logic usefulness analysis for Frontend Shell & Routing verifies decision trees support strategic business goals—matching mentors to founders, surfacing dealflow, or accelerating hiring—without extraneous branching. We trace each conditional, feature flag, and computed property back to a user or operator need, validating data derivations, ranking heuristics, and gating flows through realistic scenarios. The consolidated access layer now exposes deterministic unauthenticated and forbidden states, allowing persona dashboards, upgrade prompts, and fallback redirects to react to the same access payloads the moment `useAccessControl` resolves, and targeted regression tests guarantee those branches hold under both compliant and misconfigured sessions.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/routing/ProtectedRoute.jsx†L71-L130】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/auth/MembershipGate.jsx†L135-L152】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/auth/__tests__/membership-routes.test.jsx†L138-L218】【3cc3d3†L1-L37】 The review also inspects fallbacks, concurrency protections, and audit logging to guarantee actions remain explainable and reversible during enterprise reviews or compliance checks.
4. **Redundancies.** The guard duplication between `ProtectedRoute`, bespoke dashboard wrappers, and role gates has been removed; all three now delegate to the same access boundary while supplying persona-specific fallbacks, eliminating diverging logic paths and stale redirects.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/routing/ProtectedRoute.jsx†L71-L130】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/auth/MembershipGate.jsx†L135-L152】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/auth/ProtectedDashboardRoute.jsx†L1-L19】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/auth/RequireDashboardAccess.jsx†L42-L63】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/auth/RequireMembership.jsx†L67-L95】 Redundancy sweeps examine Frontend Shell & Routing across repositories, identifying overlapping components, duplicated reducers, redundant SQL joins, or parallel worker jobs that can be unified. We compare React hooks, backend services, and internal documentation for repeated logic, evaluate whether shared utilities can absorb divergence, and check if design tokens or typography scales are defined multiple times. Each potential redundancy is profiled for performance cost, maintenance risk, and alignment with internal coding standards, then ranked for consolidation priority.
5. **Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs.** Route gating and membership fallbacks now render production-grade upgrade surfaces and sign-in prompts instead of skeletal placeholders—the consolidated `MembershipGate` supplies branded unauthenticated journeys, upgrade checklists, and live membership badges backed by the same access payload used for navigation decisions.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/auth/MembershipGate.jsx†L26-L152】 Placeholder and stub hunting for Frontend Shell & Routing scans feature flags, TODO comments, scaffolding controllers, schema columns, and UI components that render mocked data or static cards. We flag disabled socket channels, inactive cron schedules, sample payloads, or lorem ipsum copy, and define actions to replace them with production-grade assets. Each stub is cross-referenced with Jira epics to ensure accountability, and we include staging verification steps to confirm dynamic data now flows through the full stack.
15. **Change Checklist Tracker.** Consolidate guard components → Audit preview routes → Update tokens → Regression test navigation across roles. Change checklist tracking for Frontend Shell & Routing enumerates sequencing, owners, QA artifacts, analytics instrumentation, and sign-off requirements across product, design, engineering, and go-to-market teams. Each checklist aligns with internal change management policy: update Figma specs, adjust shared contracts, regenerate API clients, write release notes, train support teams, and update mentoring playbooks. Dependencies on infrastructure, data migration, or compliance reviews are flagged early to avoid launch delays. Targeted vitest suites covering guard permutations and membership flows provide automated evidence for release sign-off, complementing manual shell QA.【3cc3d3†L1-L37】【055789†L1-L24】【f3725a†L1-L10】
