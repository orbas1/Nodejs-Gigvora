  - [x] Subcategory 2.B. Authorization & RBAC
1. **Appraisal.** Authorization & RBAC stitches backend policy enforcement with admin and mobile governance experiences. Express middleware normalises memberships, roles, and user types before protected controllers execute, ensuring every request carries consistent persona context.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/middleware/authorization.js†L1-L268】 RBAC controllers expose matrix, audit-log, and simulation endpoints while recording audit trails for compliance-grade traceability.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/rbacPolicyController.js†L1-L356】 React hooks aggregate memberships, roles, and permissions to gate navigation and feature affordances, auto-selecting the active membership when users satisfy policy requirements.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/hooks/useAuthorization.js†L1-L172】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/hooks/useRoleAccess.js†L1-L92】 Admin surfaces render persona guardrails, resources, and review cadences, and the Flutter client mirrors the same matrix so operations staff receive parity across devices.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/RbacMatrixPanel.jsx†L1-L220】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/application/rbac_matrix_provider.dart†L8-L24】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/presentation/rbac_matrix_card.dart†L8-L188】 Appraisal work compares these experiences against LinkedIn- and Workday-class benchmarks to guarantee the Gigvora stack feels trustworthy to executives, recruiters, and mentors.
   - *Security & Compliance.* Audit logging persists persona, resource, and constraint context to `RbacPolicyAuditEvent`, supporting SOC2 evidence and regulator-ready exports.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L360-L406】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/rbacPolicyAuditEvent.js†L1-L49】
   - *Accessibility.* Evaluate keyboard focus, aria semantics, and colour contrast across `RbacMatrixPanel` and the Flutter card to uphold WCAG 2.2 AA, especially for badge chips and hover-only affordances.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/RbacMatrixPanel.jsx†L176-L220】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/presentation/rbac_matrix_card.dart†L118-L188】
   - *Competitive Benchmark.* Compare guardrail storytelling, simulation UX, and audit transparency with LinkedIn Talent Insights, Workday Security, and Atlassian Cloud governance modules to target differentiation.
   - *Future Readiness.* `RBAC_MATRIX` currently covers platform, security, compliance, and operations personas; expansion to recruiter, mentor, and finance personas must be assessed for scale and review cadence updates.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L5-L233】
   - *Frontend Surface.* Validate skeleton, empty, and error states in `RbacMatrixPanel` and Flutter card so governance leaders always see polished transitions, even during refresh or outage scenarios.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/RbacMatrixPanel.jsx†L128-L220】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/presentation/rbac_matrix_card.dart†L20-L188】
   - *Backend Foundation.* Review controller dependency order, validation guards, and audit helpers to confirm policy simulations remain deterministic under load and traceable during incident response.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/rbacPolicyController.js†L230-L356】
   - *Data & Analytics.* Ensure audit events feed downstream insights—`findAndCountAll` pagination, search filters, and metadata snapshots must map cleanly into governance dashboards without drift.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L360-L420】
   - *UX & Brand.* Benchmark badge styling, typography, and microcopy (“RBAC guardrails & access matrix”) against premium professional networks to maintain credibility and warmth.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/RbacMatrixPanel.jsx†L176-L220】
2. **Functionality.** Middleware-level checks (`requireMembership`, `requireUserType`, `requireProjectManagementRole`) block unauthorised access before controllers evaluate persona context, while controllers serve matrix snapshots, filtered audit logs, and policy simulations backed by shared services.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/middleware/authorization.js†L52-L268】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/rbacPolicyController.js†L252-L352】 The admin React service client normalises query params, enforces identifier validation, and posts simulations, ensuring consistent API consumption from the UI layer.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/services/rbac.js†L1-L175】 React hooks compute membership sets, highlight missing roles, and auto-update the active membership when access is granted; Flutter providers short-circuit when the session lacks privileged memberships, keeping mobile parity tight.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/hooks/useRoleAccess.js†L29-L92】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/application/rbac_matrix_provider.dart†L8-L24】 Functionality reviews trace these flows end-to-end, from authenticated request headers through audit persistence and UI refresh states.
   - *Service Contracts.* Document `GET /admin/governance/rbac/matrix`, `GET /admin/governance/rbac/audit-events`, and `POST /admin/governance/rbac/simulate`, aligning controller responses with the `fetchRbacMatrix`, `fetchRbacAuditEvents`, and `simulateRbacDecision` contracts.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/rbacPolicyController.js†L252-L352】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/services/rbac.js†L136-L169】
   - *State Persistence.* Verify that React hooks keep session state current—`useRoleAccess` writes the selected membership via `updateSession`, and `useAuthorization` retains role/permission sets for downstream components.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/hooks/useRoleAccess.js†L29-L92】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/hooks/useAuthorization.js†L78-L168】
   - *Notifications.* Catalogue current audit logging and identify where policy denials should trigger internal notifications; today the stack records events but does not fan out alerts, leaving an opportunity for governance paging hooks.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L360-L406】
   - *Lifecycle Hooks.* Respect matrix review cadence (`reviewCadenceDays`) and UI calculations for the next review date, ensuring policy refresh reminders stay accurate across clients.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L5-L233】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/RbacMatrixPanel.jsx†L146-L174】
   - *User Journeys.* Map admin journeys from dashboard entry (DataStatus loading, error retry) through persona drilldowns and simulation flows, including Flutter empty states when access is missing.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/RbacMatrixPanel.jsx†L128-L220】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/presentation/rbac_matrix_card.dart†L20-L188】
   - *System Integrations.* Confirm `apiClient` usage inherits auth headers and retry semantics so RBAC endpoints align with broader admin networking patterns.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/services/rbac.js†L1-L175】
   - *Edge Conditions.* Exercise persona switching, expired sessions, and membership drops—controllers rely on `resolvePersonaKey` and permission maps, while Flutter providers currently return `null` when roles are absent, surfacing empty UI states.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/rbacPolicyController.js†L121-L219】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/application/rbac_matrix_provider.dart†L8-L24】
   - *Cross-Platform.* Align web and Flutter guardrail chips, review cadences, and empty/error copy so operations leaders trust the experience across devices.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/RbacMatrixPanel.jsx†L176-L220】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/presentation/rbac_matrix_card.dart†L20-L188】
3. **Logic Usefulness.** `evaluateAccess` centralises decision logic, normalising persona, resource, and action values before resolving allow/deny outcomes with constraint metadata, while controllers translate those evaluations into audit entries and HTTP responses.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L245-L348】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/rbacPolicyController.js†L311-L352】 Persona resolution is role- and permission-aware, expanding privileged coverage when governance permissions are present; audit helpers capture actor context for explainability.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/rbacPolicyController.js†L102-L219】 Logic reviews ensure these branches continue to support high-stakes scenarios—incident response, compliance exports, mentor programme governance—without introducing arbitrary friction.
   - *Personalisation.* Verify `resolveAllowedPersonas` and session-derived role sets adapt surfaces based on memberships and scopes, keeping experiences relevant to admins vs. operations leads.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/rbacPolicyController.js†L102-L152】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/hooks/useAuthorization.js†L78-L168】
   - *Conflict Resolution.* Ensure request role collectors deduplicate headers/body inputs and audit logging gracefully handles write failures via logger fallbacks.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/middleware/authorization.js†L132-L198】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L360-L406】
   - *Scenario Coverage.* Simulate high-volume audits and rapid persona switching to confirm `listPolicyAuditEvents` pagination and `resolvePersonaKey` logic maintain deterministic outcomes.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L360-L420】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/rbacPolicyController.js†L174-L256】
   - *Data Provenance.* Preserve source-of-truth indicators—policy key, resource key, constraints—in both API responses and stored events for regulator audits.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/rbacPolicyController.js†L252-L352】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/rbacPolicyAuditEvent.js†L1-L49】
   - *Decision Trees.* Document persona-to-resource grants from the static matrix and ensure UI surfaces (React & Flutter) expose rationale for allowed/denied actions.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L5-L233】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/RbacMatrixPanel.jsx†L69-L120】
   - *Business Alignment.* Tie grants back to product outcomes—runtime telemetry for platform admins, consent publishing for compliance managers, maintenance scheduling for operations leads.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L10-L233】
   - *Observability.* Maintain audit logging on every matrix/audit/simulation call so security officers can trace decisions quickly during incidents.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/rbacPolicyController.js†L252-L352】
   - *Recovery Paths.* Define fallbacks for unknown personas or missing grants—current logic returns explicit deny reasons (`unknown-persona`, `no-matching-grant`) that UI layers should surface with guidance.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L290-L348】
4. **Redundancies.** Duplicated role constants (`PROJECT_MANAGEMENT_ROLES`) live in middleware and React hooks, increasing drift risk when roles change.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/middleware/authorization.js†L105-L198】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/hooks/useAuthorization.js†L4-L156】 Similar normalisation helpers appear across middleware, controllers, and services, and persona-to-role mappings are hard-coded in multiple layers. Consolidating these into shared utilities or shared-contract exports prevents subtle inconsistencies across web, API, and mobile clients.
   - *Role Constants.* Extract shared role/persona enumerations to a contract consumed by middleware, hooks, and mobile providers.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/rbacPolicyController.js†L10-L115】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/application/rbac_matrix_provider.dart†L8-L24】
   - *Normalisation Helpers.* Deduplicate string normalisers across middleware and services to reduce maintenance overhead.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/middleware/authorization.js†L3-L50】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L236-L260】
   - *UI Grants.* `RbacMatrixPanel` slices the first three grants, and Flutter mirrors a subset—promote shared presentation utilities to avoid divergent truncation rules.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/RbacMatrixPanel.jsx†L94-L99】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/presentation/rbac_matrix_card.dart†L127-L188】
   - *Audit Helpers.* The audit helper inside the controller replicates request context extraction logic already available in other utilities; centralisation keeps instrumentation consistent.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/rbacPolicyController.js†L214-L352】
5. **Placeholders or non-working functions or stubs.** Some governance affordances still behave like placeholders. UI panels intentionally truncate persona grants (`slice(0, 3)`), hiding the majority of policies until expanded designs ship, and Flutter renders a generic empty-state message rather than role-specific guidance.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/RbacMatrixPanel.jsx†L94-L120】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/presentation/rbac_matrix_card.dart†L100-L188】 The audit model defines a `'challenge'` decision state, yet services only persist allow/deny, leaving the escalation path unimplemented.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/rbacPolicyAuditEvent.js†L1-L33】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L360-L406】 Cataloguing these gaps lets us replace them with production experiences before enterprise rollouts.
   - *UI Completion.* Expand web and mobile panels to render full grant lists with pagination or drill-ins so administrators are not blocked by preview-only cards.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/RbacMatrixPanel.jsx†L94-L120】
   - *Decision States.* Either implement or retire the `'challenge'` audit state so data exports stay internally consistent.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/rbacPolicyAuditEvent.js†L1-L33】
   - *Empty-state Guidance.* Update Flutter empty-state copy to explain how to request privileged memberships instead of signalling a passive future update.【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/presentation/rbac_matrix_card.dart†L100-L188】
   - *Documentation Sync.* Ensure governance runbooks reflect the live personas and resources enumerated in `RBAC_MATRIX` rather than placeholder scopes.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L5-L233】
6. **Duplicate Functions.** Beyond role arrays, string normalisation and persona resolution logic repeat across services, middleware, and controllers. Consolidating these functions avoids divergent behaviour when new persona keys or resource identifiers are introduced.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/middleware/authorization.js†L3-L50】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/rbacPolicyController.js†L63-L196】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L236-L348】 Shared helpers should also power Flutter providers to prevent mobile drift.
   - *Normalisers.* Promote a single normalise utility for roles, memberships, and personas that web, backend, and mobile can import.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/middleware/authorization.js†L3-L132】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/application/rbac_matrix_provider.dart†L8-L24】
   - *Persona Mapping.* Align `ROLE_TO_PERSONA` logic with Flutter’s accessible role set to avoid mismatched eligibility checks.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/rbacPolicyController.js†L10-L152】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/application/rbac_matrix_provider.dart†L8-L24】
   - *Audit Writers.* Collapse controller-level audit helpers and service-level event writers into a shared module with retry semantics so every policy decision uses identical instrumentation.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/rbacPolicyController.js†L214-L352】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L360-L406】
7. **Improvements need to make.** Introduce policy analytics that highlight denials by persona, resource, and action, allowing admins to spot friction quickly. Expand the static matrix to include recruiter, mentor, finance, and volunteer personas with clear guardrails while maintaining compliance-grade audit depth.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L5-L233】 Build shared constants for roles/personas, hydrate them into React hooks and Flutter providers, and surface progressive disclosure for full grant lists on the web panel. Add health indicators for audit-log latency and simulation throughput so SRE teams can detect regressions before customers notice.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/RbacMatrixPanel.jsx†L201-L220】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L360-L420】
8. **Styling improvements.** The admin panel already leans into glassmorphism and premium badges, but hover transitions and focus outlines should be standardised across grant chips and guardrail cards. Elevate empty/error states with illustrated treatments that match the enterprise tone on LinkedIn-scale products, and mirror those visuals in Flutter with Material 3 theming tokens.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/RbacMatrixPanel.jsx†L20-L120】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/presentation/rbac_matrix_card.dart†L14-L188】 Leverage shared design tokens so audit metrics, guardrails, and resource cards share typography hierarchy, accent gradients, and elevation scales.
9. **Efficiency analysis and improvement.** `getPolicyMatrix` clones the full matrix on every request, and `listPolicyAuditEvents` executes full `findAndCountAll` queries even for narrow slices, so caching and precomputed aggregates will reduce overhead as the matrix grows.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L236-L420】 React panels refetch the matrix on refresh without caching, and Flutter reruns the provider after every authentication change; memoising responses and adding conditional revalidation will keep admin experiences snappy.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/RbacMatrixPanel.jsx†L128-L220】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/application/rbac_matrix_provider.dart†L8-L24】
10. **Strengths to Keep.** Central evaluation logic and audit persistence already provide enterprise-grade explainability, while React hooks automatically align active memberships with granted roles so users glide into eligible workspaces.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L236-L348】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/hooks/useRoleAccess.js†L29-L92】 Cross-platform parity—web panel plus Flutter card—means operations leaders stay informed wherever they work, and the static matrix captures guardrails, resources, and review cadences in one authoritative source.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L5-L233】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/presentation/rbac_matrix_card.dart†L20-L188】
11. **Weaknesses to remove.** Persona coverage remains skewed toward internal operations; product, recruiter, and mentor personas still rely on legacy access paths. React and backend role constants drift independently, risking inconsistent gating. Audit exports lack challenge/appeal outcomes despite the model supporting them. Addressing these gaps elevates trust for enterprise buyers who expect complete governance visibility.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L5-L233】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/rbacPolicyAuditEvent.js†L1-L33】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/hooks/useAuthorization.js†L4-L156】
12. **Styling and Colour review changes.** Align admin badges (emerald, slate, rose palettes) with the broader brand system, introducing role-specific accents (e.g., security amber, compliance navy) and ensuring dark-mode equivalents exist. Reinforce focus-visible outlines on guardrail cards and ensure Flutter chips adopt Material colour harmonisation for accessibility.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/RbacMatrixPanel.jsx†L13-L120】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/presentation/rbac_matrix_card.dart†L118-L188】
13. **CSS, orientation, placement and arrangement changes.** Refine grid breakpoints so the matrix summary, persona cards, and guardrail lists remain legible on narrow admin viewports; today the panel uses a four-column grid on desktop and stack layouts on mobile, but we should validate large-screen density and RTL support.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/RbacMatrixPanel.jsx†L103-L220】 Flutter layouts should likewise confirm landscape/tablet experiences keep guardrail metrics above the fold.【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/presentation/rbac_matrix_card.dart†L118-L188】
14. **Text analysis, placement, length, redundancy, quality.** Review microcopy such as “RBAC guardrails & access matrix” (web) and “Guardrail catalogue not yet published” (Flutter) to ensure tone stays authoritative yet reassuring. Introduce persona-aware helper text that explains why access is limited and how to request upgrades, replacing generic placeholders.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/RbacMatrixPanel.jsx†L176-L220】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/presentation/rbac_matrix_card.dart†L100-L188】
15. **Change Checklist Tracker.** Sequence RBAC enhancements: align `RBAC_MATRIX` updates with shared-contract exports, regenerate API clients, expand web/mobile UI, and extend integration tests that hit matrix, audit, and simulation endpoints.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L5-L420】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/services/rbac.js†L136-L175】 Include security review, privacy impact assessment, and support training before rollout, and wire telemetry to monitor denials per persona plus API latency post-release.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/rbacPolicyController.js†L252-L352】
16. **Full Upgrade Plan & Release Steps.** Phase work through discovery (persona gap analysis, policy workshop), build (shared constants, controller updates, UI expansion), validation (unit + integration tests, accessibility audits, load testing on audit endpoints), and launch (feature-flag the new matrix, monitor audit volumes, collect governance feedback). Tie each phase to rollback criteria so we can revert to the previous matrix if telemetry or compliance checks fail.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/rbacPolicyController.js†L252-L352】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/RbacMatrixPanel.jsx†L201-L220】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L5-L420】
  - [ ] Subcategory 2.B. Authorization & RBAC
1. **Appraisal.** RBAC policies enforce granular permissions across calendar, finance, messaging, admin, and mentorship features using `rbacPolicyService` and `middleware/authorization`.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/middleware/authorization.js†L1-L189】 The Authorization & RBAC stack is evaluated holistically across browser, phone, and admin personas, weighing how React shells, Flutter layouts, and server-rendered fragments reinforce a premium professional tone. Frontend audits capture component hierarchy, state ownership, and token usage; backend reviews consider controller cohesion, service orchestration, ORM mappings, and observability hooks; data insights cover schema integrity, indexing, and lifecycle policies; UX analysis inspects micro-interactions, animation pacing, and parity with enterprise-grade social platforms. The assessment also benchmarks maturity against LinkedIn-class expectations, identifying signature touches—such as hover affordances, in-card analytics, and responsive typography—that convey credibility to executives, recruiters, founders, and mentors alike.
   - *Security & Compliance.* Check Authorization & RBAC for adherence to SOC2 guardrails, encryption policies, and audit logging expectations demanded by enterprise partners.
   - *Accessibility.* Validate keyboard navigation, ARIA labelling, and screen reader order in Authorization & RBAC align with WCAG 2.2 AA.
   - *Competitive Benchmark.* Compare Authorization & RBAC metrics and features to LinkedIn, AngelList, and other executive platforms to prioritise differentiators.
   - *Future Readiness.* Evaluate how Authorization & RBAC accommodates roadmap expansions like deeper mentor tiers, enhanced analytics overlays, or expanded executive services without re-architecture.
   - *Frontend Surface.* Audit how Authorization & RBAC components mount within `AppLayout`, verifying skeleton loaders, route transitions, and viewport breakpoints deliver seamless entry states regardless of device size.
   - *Backend Foundation.* Review service initialisation order, dependency injection boundaries, and resilience patterns (circuit breakers, retries) that keep Authorization & RBAC endpoints predictable under load spikes.
   - *Data & Analytics.* Trace entity lineage through Sequelize models, migrations, and warehouse exports to ensure Authorization & RBAC aggregates power downstream insights without drift.
   - *UX & Brand.* Compare animation curves, iconography, and grid density against executive-network competitors to guarantee Authorization & RBAC feels polished, modern, and trustworthy.
2. **Functionality.** Frontend gating hooks check session roles before exposing navigation, with fallback tooltips guiding upgrades.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/hooks/useRoleGate.js†L1-L82】 Functionality deep-dives map every request/response exchange, websocket emission, worker hand-off, and scheduled job for Authorization & RBAC, ensuring each persona journey flows without dead ends. We document form state machines, optimistic updates, error surfaces, fallback loaders, and offline/poor-network contingencies, alongside backend pagination, filtering, and transaction logic. Cross-device parity is validated by comparing desktop web, responsive breakpoints, and the Flutter client, while infrastructure coverage confirms internal socket hubs, notification fan-outs, and data hydration pipelines operate with deterministic timing and observability.
   - *Service Contracts.* Document request/response schemas, expected status codes, and error envelopes for Authorization & RBAC endpoints.
   - *State Persistence.* Confirm Authorization & RBAC persists drafts, filters, and preferences across sessions using secure storage.
   - *Notifications.* Trace how Authorization & RBAC triggers in-app, email, and push notifications, ensuring deduplication across channels.
   - *Lifecycle Hooks.* Audit cron jobs, data refresh windows, and retention rules that sustain Authorization & RBAC's freshness.
   - *User Journeys.* Document every entry point into Authorization & RBAC, from deep-link navigation to contextual modals, capturing validation, error recovery, and success confirmation states.
   - *System Integrations.* Enumerate internal API calls, socket topics, and worker queues triggered by Authorization & RBAC, highlighting sequencing and dependency contracts.
   - *Edge Conditions.* Simulate throttled networks, large payloads, permission changes, and session expiry to confirm Authorization & RBAC degrades gracefully.
   - *Cross-Platform.* Align behaviour between web React views and Flutter screens, including gesture patterns, offline caching, and haptic feedback.
3. **Logic Usefulness.** Policy evaluation occurs centrally, reducing duplication and enabling dynamic policy updates. Logic usefulness analysis for Authorization & RBAC verifies decision trees support strategic business goals—matching mentors to founders, surfacing dealflow, or accelerating hiring—without extraneous branching. We trace each conditional, feature flag, and computed property back to a user or operator need, validating data derivations, ranking heuristics, and gating flows through realistic scenarios. The review also inspects fallbacks, concurrency protections, and audit logging to guarantee actions remain explainable and reversible during enterprise reviews or compliance checks.
   - *Personalisation.* Assess algorithms tailoring Authorization & RBAC output based on role, intent, and behaviour, guaranteeing fairness and transparency.
   - *Conflict Resolution.* Inspect concurrency guards preventing double submissions or race conditions within Authorization & RBAC.
   - *Scenario Coverage.* Run tabletop exercises for extreme cases (e.g., high-volume hiring campaigns) to confirm Authorization & RBAC scales logically.
   - *Data Provenance.* Verify Authorization & RBAC surfaces source-of-truth indicators so executives trust displayed metrics.
   - *Decision Trees.* Map conditional flows, feature flags, and gating logic that determine visibility of Authorization & RBAC modules for each persona.
   - *Business Alignment.* Validate that scoring models, prioritisation, and nudges in Authorization & RBAC directly advance mentor matching, hiring velocity, or founder growth.
   - *Observability.* Ensure logs, metrics, and distributed traces explain why Authorization & RBAC made each decision for audit readiness.
   - *Recovery Paths.* Check fallback logic for missing data, upstream outages, or conflicting updates so Authorization & RBAC maintains continuity.
4. **Redundancies.** Multiple role constants defined across pages; centralise in `constants/roles.js`. Redundancy sweeps examine Authorization & RBAC across repositories, identifying overlapping components, duplicated reducers, redundant SQL joins, or parallel worker jobs that can be unified. We compare React hooks, backend services, and internal documentation for repeated logic, evaluate whether shared utilities can absorb divergence, and check if design tokens or typography scales are defined multiple times. Each potential redundancy is profiled for performance cost, maintenance risk, and alignment with internal coding standards, then ranked for consolidation priority.
   - *Dependency Graph.* Visualise libraries and packages Authorization & RBAC relies on, spotting overlapping utilities or polyfills.
   - *Documentation.* Consolidate wiki pages and runbooks to avoid conflicting Authorization & RBAC guidance for support teams.
   - *Design Tokens.* Remove duplicate hex codes or spacing constants referenced in Authorization & RBAC's SCSS/Tailwind layers.
   - *Analytics Events.* Merge event names capturing similar actions within Authorization & RBAC to simplify dashboards.
   - *Code Review.* Identify duplicate hooks, helpers, and selectors powering Authorization & RBAC; evaluate consolidation into shared utilities.
   - *Schema Review.* Detect redundant columns or join tables left from deprecated products, planning migrations that clean Authorization & RBAC's data footprint.
   - *UI Audit.* Remove overlapping cards or widgets presenting similar metrics; emphasise the highest-signal rendition in Authorization & RBAC.
   - *Process Review.* Align team ownership to prevent parallel implementations of Authorization & RBAC in different repos.
5. **Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs.** Some policies still mention course/community scopes—remove and migrate to mentor/group permissions. Placeholder and stub hunting for Authorization & RBAC scans feature flags, TODO comments, scaffolding controllers, schema columns, and UI components that render mocked data or static cards. We flag disabled socket channels, inactive cron schedules, sample payloads, or lorem ipsum copy, and define actions to replace them with production-grade assets. Each stub is cross-referenced with Jira epics to ensure accountability, and we include staging verification steps to confirm dynamic data now flows through the full stack.
   - *Feature Flags.* Catalogue temporary toggles shielding unfinished Authorization & RBAC behaviour and schedule their removal.
   - *Testing Coverage.* Replace stubbed tests with integration suites that hit live services powering Authorization & RBAC.
   - *Docs & Training.* Update knowledge base entries to remove mention of placeholders replaced within Authorization & RBAC.
   - *Data Migration.* Plan scripts converting placeholder values into production-grade defaults for Authorization & RBAC records.
