14. **Text analysis, placement, length, redundancy, quality.** Timeline copy should celebrate momentum, surface opportunity signals, and explain next actions with enterprise polish.
   - *Opportunity Spotlights.* When a feed entry represents a job, gig, or project, pair the title with the “Opportunity spotlight” banner so readers instantly recognise hiring or collaboration intent (see `FeedPostCard`).
   - *Microcopy Voice.* Reaction rollups refer to “appreciations” rather than generic “likes,” reinforcing the professional tone while quantifying engagement in the summary badge.
   - *Action Prompts.* Links and share CTAs remain outcome-focused—e.g., “Share externally” or “View attached resource”—and should mention whether they trigger referrals, applications, or knowledge sharing.
   - *Scannability.* Limit body paragraphs to four lines with whitespace between sections so busy mentors can scan wins, context, and calls-to-action without fatigue.

7. **Improvements need to make.** Multi-reaction support now renders five professional sentiments, updates summary badges, and persists optimistic state across the feed. Next upgrades focus on richer insights, moderation, and cross-platform polish so engagement stays premium.
   - *Realtime Consistency.* Wire socket fan-out so `normaliseReactionSummary` receives live tallies instead of waiting for manual refreshes, keeping badges accurate during fast-moving launches.
   - *Mobile Reach.* Mirror the reaction picker inside the Flutter client, matching the `REACTION_OPTIONS` taxonomy and ensuring touch affordances feel native.
   - *Moderation Hooks.* Extend existing analytics events (`web_feed_reaction_click`, `web_feed_comment_submit`) with admin context so trust-and-safety teams can trace abuse escalations.
   - *Reply Enhancements.* Provide smart reply templates per persona (mentor, founder, recruiter) and expose inline edit for recently posted comments to reduce churn.
   - *Observability.* Dashboards should chart palette usage, comment-to-reaction ratios, and failure counts from `reactToFeedPost` to prove business outcomes.
8. **Styling improvements.** Reaction controls lean on glassy capsules, tinted badges, and pill summaries to rival LinkedIn polish. Continue evolving the systemised aesthetic while safeguarding accessibility.
   - *Palette Governance.* Document the dot colors used in `REACTION_OPTIONS` (sky, amber, emerald, violet, rose) and link them to design tokens so other squads reuse the same emotion spectrum.
   - *Menu Motion.* Apply a 180–220 ms ease when the picker opens; subtle drop shadows and staggered icon fades reinforce premium craft.
   - *Summary Badge.* Keep the appreciation chip (`px-3 py-1`, rounded-full) anchored near actions, switching to a stacked layout below 640 px for readability.
   - *Emoji & GIF Popovers.* Align tray headers, dividers, and focus states with the reaction picker to deliver one cohesive popover language.
9. **Efficiency analysis and improvement.** `handleReactionChange` batches deactivate/activate calls with `Promise.all`, but we must still profile the full pipeline to avoid saturation during peak events.
   - *Network Hygiene.* Instrument latency on `/feed/:id/reactions` and retry throttled calls with exponential backoff so optimistic UI stays trustworthy.
   - *Render Budgets.* Use React Profiler to confirm the picker and summary chips re-render only when `reactionSummary` changes; memoise where necessary.
   - *Pagination.* Ensure `listFeedComments` respects cancellation (already using `AbortController`) and audit thread virtualization for 100+ replies.
   - *Analytics Sampling.* Buffer reaction events client-side to ship in micro-batches, balancing fidelity with network overhead.
   - *Stress Scenarios.* Simulate mentors toggling reactions rapidly to validate `setActiveReaction` never produces negative counts.
10. **Strengths to Keep.** Preserve the empathetic, fast UI moments that already delight power users.
   - *Optimistic Loops.* Keep instant comment/reply insertion with graceful rollback so conversations feel live even on flaky networks.
   - *Quick Replies.* Maintain the curated `QUICK_REPLY_SUGGESTIONS` strings; they spark thoughtful engagement without sounding robotic.
   - *Accessible Palette.* Retain keyboard/touch parity for the reaction picker (`aria-expanded`, escape handling) and keep the summary badge announcing updates with `aria-live`.
   - *Moderation Safeguards.* Continue running payloads through `moderateFeedComposerPayload` so spam never leaks into the feed.
11. **Weaknesses to remove.** Close gaps that still risk credibility or responsiveness.
   - *Offline Grace.* Provide queued reactions/comments when the device drops offline, flushing once connectivity returns.
   - *Error Surfaces.* Surface toasts when reaction sync fails instead of silent console warnings, giving members confidence their intent landed.
   - *Long Threads.* Introduce “Show more replies” pagination to avoid vertical fatigue on heavily engaged posts.
   - *Persona Tone.* Audit quick replies and placeholder copy so they stay relevant for founders, mentors, and talent partners alike.
   - *Analytics Drift.* Verify backend aggregators treat `support` vs `love` aliases identically to avoid mis-reporting sentiments.
12. **Styling and Colour review changes.** Calibrate the new appreciation spectrum with brand guidelines.
   - *Contrast Audits.* Test each dot/background pair in light and dark themes to exceed WCAG 2.2 AA for text and iconography.
   - *Hover States.* Define lighter tint variations for palette buttons when hovered/focused so visual feedback feels intentional.
   - *Badge Typography.* Use semibold 0.7 rem uppercase text in summary chips, matching other feed metrics for visual harmony.
   - *Export Modes.* Ensure screenshots or PDFs preserve the gradient and blur treatments applied to reaction controls for investor decks.
   - *Iconography.* Keep heroicons at 16–20 px inside 24–28 px pills for crisp retina rendering.
13. **CSS, orientation, placement and arrangement changes.** Reaction controls now combine a capsule button, chevron trigger, and appreciation badge; layout rules must scale across breakpoints.
   - *Flex Behaviour.* Keep the action row as a wrapping flex container so reactions, comments, and share buttons reflow on narrow screens.
   - *Hit Targets.* Maintain 40 px minimum hit zones for palette toggles and ensure focus outlines are visible against tinted backgrounds.
   - *Menu Placement.* Clamp the picker within the viewport by flipping it above the button when close to the bottom of the screen.
   - *RTL Support.* Mirror icon order and badge alignment when the interface runs right-to-left, avoiding overlap with the summary chip.
   - *Responsive Summary.* Collapse the appreciation badge beneath the action row below 480 px to protect copy legibility.
14. **Text analysis, placement, length, redundancy, quality.** Reaction microcopy emphasises appreciation and celebration language instead of casual slang.
   - *Palette Labels.* Keep verbs aspirational—“Appreciate”, “Celebrate”, “Support”, “Insightful”, “Curious”—so executives feel respected.
   - *Summary Copy.* Use “appreciation(s)” in the badge to reinforce positive culture while staying concise.
   - *Comment Prompts.* Retain prompts like “Join the conversation” and “Offer context, signal interest…” to encourage thoughtful, multi-sentence replies.
   - *Error Messaging.* Align comment/reaction errors with supportive tone (“We could not load the latest conversation. Please try again soon.”).
15. **Change Checklist Tracker.** Palette rollout requires tight coordination across product, design, engineering, and enablement.
   - *Design Sign-off.* Capture final swatches, iconography, and motion specs in Figma before development.
   - *Analytics Wiring.* Update event schemas and dashboards to track reaction-type adoption and comment depth after release.
   - *QA Matrix.* Test keyboard navigation, screen reader announcements, and touch gestures on major browsers/devices.
   - *Support Readiness.* Brief community managers on the new sentiments and provide guidance on moderating celebratory vs support reactions.
   - *Documentation.* Refresh runbooks detailing `reactToFeedPost` usage, optimistic update expectations, and rollback procedures.
   - *Launch Plan.* Stage via feature flag—internal dogfood → mentor beta → full network—while monitoring error rates and sentiment mix.
16. **Full Upgrade Plan & Release Steps.** Roll out multi-reaction analytics, moderation hooks, and mobile parity in a staged program: discovery → dual-track build → comprehensive QA → telemetry-backed launch. Maintain rollback scripts and guardrails so reactions remain trustworthy during peak hiring pushes.
