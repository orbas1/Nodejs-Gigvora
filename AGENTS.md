1. Global Navigation & Shell
1.A. Header & Top Navigation âœ…
   1. Consolidated the header structure into a three-zone layout with responsive flex behaviour so navigation, search, and actions breathe on large viewports while gracefully stacking on mobile. The gridless approach reduces horizontal crowding and keeps orientation consistent across breakpoints.
   2. Introduced a Headless UI-driven Insights flyout that combines navigation pulse metrics and trending destinations within an accessible popover, replacing always-on side rails to declutter the shell while surfacing the same intelligence on demand.
   3. Refined the marketing search experience with a centred pill control that expands under focus, supports keyboard submission, and resets gracefully after navigation, making global discovery more prominent without overwhelming the hero rail.
   4. Preserved authenticated role switching and primary navigation clusters alongside the logo, ensuring governance personas stay visible while the marketing mega menus remain within easy reach for unauthenticated visitors.
   5. Retained inbox previews, notifications, language selection, and creation shortcuts, aligning them inside a balanced action group with measured spacing so power workflows remain one click away without visual noise.
   6. Maintained analytics tracking for trending destinations through the insights flyout so navigation telemetry continues to register persona-aware engagement even after the UI consolidation.
   7. Applied translucent shell treatments, subtle gradients, and backdrop blur adjustments to reinforce a premium, LinkedIn-calibre aesthetic with restrained highlights rather than dense decorative blocks.
   8. Layered a mobile-first quick search dialog with curated trending deep links so small-screen users can instantly launch people, opportunity, and workspace discovery without diving into the mega menus.
   9. Instrumented global search submissions with persona-aware analytics and reset behaviour while echoing insights tracking inside the quick search drawer, ensuring navigation intelligence and query journeys stay observable across entry points.
