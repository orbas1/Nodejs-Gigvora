   - *Ops Telemetry.* Worker manager telemetry feeds runtime observability, broadcasting queue depth, stuck lock detection, and failure tallies for each orchestrator loop.
   - *Realtime Telemetry.* `getRuntimeOperationalSnapshot` now emits a `realtime` block derived from the socket server connection registry, mapping namespaces, user/socket counts, and anomaly signals when limits are breached.
   - *Worker Health Streams.* Operational snapshots aggregate `collectWorkerTelemetry` output into a `workers` summary that highlights queue depth, stuck jobs, and failure counts for every orchestrator.
1. **Appraisal.** Observability services provide metrics, tracing, and structured logging for backend operations, aggregating readiness, rate limits, perimeter and WAF posture, database pools, realtime sockets, and worker telemetry into a single runtime snapshot for operations teams.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/runtimeObservabilityService.js†L1-L398】 Database connectivity, pool saturation, and migration drift are surfaced through the lifecycle service, while worker health is sampled from the orchestrator to ensure live queue depth and failure telemetry remain in sync with production workloads.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/databaseLifecycleService.js†L200-L282】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/lifecycle/workerManager.js†L1-L214】 The Observability & Telemetry stack is evaluated holistically across browser, phone, and admin personas, weighing how React shells, Flutter layouts, and server-rendered fragments reinforce a premium professional tone. Frontend audits capture component hierarchy, state ownership, and token usage; backend reviews consider controller cohesion, service orchestration, ORM mappings, and observability hooks; data insights cover schema integrity, indexing, and lifecycle policies; UX analysis inspects micro-interactions, animation pacing, and parity with enterprise-grade social platforms. The assessment also benchmarks maturity against LinkedIn-class expectations, identifying signature touches—such as hover affordances, in-card analytics, and responsive typography—that convey credibility to executives, recruiters, founders, and mentors alike.
1. **Appraisal.** Platform workers for profile engagement, news aggregation, and governance digests run on the internal orchestrator, with queue lifecycle telemetry registered for operations dashboards.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/lifecycle/workerManager.js†L1-L266】 The platform settings digest pipeline persists structured events through the audit worker and watcher services, backed by Sequelize models, migrations, and production seeders so governance alerts align with database reality.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/platformSettingsAuditWorker.js†L1-L287】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/platformSettingsAuditEvent.js†L1-L56】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/database/migrations/20250305120000-add-platform-settings-audit-events.cjs†L1-L58】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/database/seeders/20250308124500-platform-settings-watchers-seed.cjs†L1-L75】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/platformSettingsWatchersService.js†L1-L340】 The Internal Worker & Orchestrator stack is evaluated holistically across browser, phone, and admin personas, weighing how React shells, Flutter layouts, and server-rendered fragments reinforce a premium professional tone.
