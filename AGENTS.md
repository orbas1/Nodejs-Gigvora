## Main Category 1. Platform Foundation

### Subcategory 1.A. Frontend Shell & Routing
1. **Appraisal.** The React entry (`src/main.jsx`, `src/App.jsx`) bootstraps routing, suspense loaders, and persona-aware layouts that wrap every page in shared navigation and session context.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/main.jsx†L1-L35】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/App.jsx†L1-L131】 The Frontend Shell & Routing stack is evaluated holistically across browser, phone, and admin personas, weighing how React shells, Flutter layouts, and server-rendered fragments reinforce a premium professional tone. Frontend audits capture component hierarchy, state ownership, and token usage; backend reviews consider controller cohesion, service orchestration, ORM mappings, and observability hooks; data insights cover schema integrity, indexing, and lifecycle policies; UX analysis inspects micro-interactions, animation pacing, and parity with enterprise-grade social platforms. The assessment also benchmarks maturity against LinkedIn-class expectations, identifying signature touches—such as hover affordances, in-card analytics, and responsive typography—that convey credibility to executives, recruiters, founders, and mentors alike.
   - *Security & Compliance.* Check Frontend Shell & Routing for adherence to SOC2 guardrails, encryption policies, and audit logging expectations demanded by enterprise partners.
