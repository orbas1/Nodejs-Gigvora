         - Buttons remain pill-shaped aligning with marketplace actions.
         - Attachment chips adopt rounded-2xl shells for coherence.
         - Stepper badges maintain circular forms signifying progress checkpoints.
     17. Shadow, hover, glow and effects
         - Buttons include hover transitions and disabled opacity for clarity.
         - AI banner uses dashed border to differentiate assistive section.
         - Attachment cards apply subtle shadow when hovered for interactive feedback.
         - Maintain overlay backdrop at 40% opacity for focus without fully darkening UI.
     18. Thumbnails
         - Attachment list ready to display file-type icons; plan asset set for PDF/DOCX/ZIP.
         - Future enhancements could include preview thumbnails for case studies.
         - Consider candidate avatar preview when identity verification integrates.
         - Document recommended aspect ratios for embedded video intros.
     19. Images and media & Images and media previews
         - File input currently text-based; plan to incorporate preview chips once upload API finalizes.
         - Ensure attachments support drag-and-drop in future iterations.
         - Provide alt text or accessible description when previews arrive.
         - Guarantee file size display remains human-readable (MB) for clarity.
     20. Button styling
         - Next/Back buttons follow accent + outline pairing mirroring design system.
         - Submit button toggles spinner icon when submitting to signal processing.
         - Add iconography (ArrowLongRightIcon) reinforcing navigation direction.
         - Maintain disabled styles to prevent double submissions.
     21. Interactiveness
         - Drawer traps focus appropriately thanks to Headless UI; keep QA on keyboard journeys.
         - Achievements textareas support dynamic addition/removal enabling storytelling control.
         - Remote preference buttons behave like toggles for quick selection.
         - Consent checkbox wired to error messaging to enforce compliance.
     22. Missing Components
         - Integrate calendar selector for interview availability once scheduler API ready.
         - Add auto-complete for location/timezone fields leveraging profile data.
         - Provide voice note/video introduction upload to humanize submissions.
         - Enable recruiter-specific questionnaires using dynamic step injection.
     23. Design Changes
         - Consider left-aligned progress tracker on desktop for even richer storytelling.
         - Introduce timeline summary of steps completed with statuses for future revisit sessions.
         - Allow save-as-draft to revisit later through job hub.
         - Offer AI tone selection to tailor generated narratives.
     24. Design Duplication
         - Reuse Stepper pattern across onboarding wizards to standardize progress communication.
         - Centralize AchievementField for other brag-doc modules to avoid clones.
         - Share consent messaging with other legal touchpoints to ensure consistency.
         - Align attachment upload module with document studio for reuse.
     25. Design framework
         - Document stepper states, color tokens, and typography for system inclusion.
         - Map field spacing, placeholder copy, and button hierarchy to design tokens.
         - Outline responsive behavior (single-column fields on mobile) for design QA.
         - Provide guidelines for integrating AI assist modules across ecosystem.
     26. Change Checklist Tracker Extensive
         - Validate backend endpoints for file upload, AI draft, and application submission.
         - Run accessibility testing (screen reader, keyboard) before broad release.
         - QA multi-step validation flows including error recovery.
         - Pilot with power users, gather feedback on friction, adjust before GA.
     27. Full Upgrade Plan & Release Steps Extensive
         - Phase 1: launch base apply drawer with manual submission to beta talent cohort.
         - Phase 2: enable AI drafting + autosave, monitor completion rates.
         - Phase 3: roll out scheduler integration and dynamic questionnaires.
         - Phase 4: global launch with marketing support, integrate analytics-driven iteration loop.
