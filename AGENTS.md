  - [x] Subcategory 4.B. Jobs & Applications
   - *Testing Coverage.* Replace stubbed tests with integration suites that hit live services powering Jobs & Applications, including the Vitest analytics coverage that exercises empty pipelines, outsized totals, and severity chip rendering in `JobsPageAnalytics.test.jsx`.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/pages/__tests__/JobsPageAnalytics.test.jsx†L193-L312】
14. **Text analysis, placement, length, redundancy, quality.** Copy across the Jobs & Applications workspace must communicate executive-ready insights without sacrificing warmth or clarity. Editorial sweeps centre personas (founders, talent partners, mentors) and ensure analytics, stage tooling, and follow-up prompts carry clear verbs, measurable outcomes, and empathetic tone.
   - *Persona Narratives.* Audit every analytics headline, badge, and helper string to confirm the promise (“keep momentum”, “share of pipeline”) aligns with the user’s current intent (scan, decide, act).【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/pages/JobsPage.jsx†L1694-L1810】
   - *Vocabulary Governance.* Maintain a shared glossary for status names, severity levels, and CTA verbs so stage guidance, recommended follow-ups, and recruiter touchpoints reuse identical phrasing across web, mobile, and email surfaces.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/pages/JobsPage.jsx†L1718-L1799】
   - *Temporal Clarity.* Normalise time references (e.g., “Avg response turnaround”, “Last pipeline update”) into short, scannable statements that always specify unit and context, avoiding redundant qualifiers.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/pages/JobsPage.jsx†L1709-L1715】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/pages/JobsPage.jsx†L1718-L1725】
