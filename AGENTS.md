  - [x] Subcategory 4.C. Gigs & Projects
1. **Appraisal.** The public listing, workspace shells, and admin controls for projects span React surfaces, backend controllers, and shared services. Portfolio-quality evaluation inspects the `ProjectsPage.jsx` listing experience, the reusable `ProjectOpportunityCard.jsx`, the detail view in `ProjectDetailPage.jsx`, and workspace modules such as `ProjectWorkspaceSection.jsx` and `ProjectWorkspaceModule.jsx`. On the backend we audit controllers orchestrating creation, operations, and workspace automation—`projectController.js`, `projectWorkspaceController.js`, and `projectOperationsController.js`—alongside `projectService.js` and `projects.js` client utilities. Reviews score how typography, gradients, and micro-interactions compare to LinkedIn-calibre execution while confirming that escalation logs, audit trails, and scoped access in `useProjectManagementAccess` preserve enterprise credibility. Cross-platform parity covers web dashboards, Flutter modules, and admin consoles so exec sponsors see consistent polish.
   - *Security & Compliance.* Confirm SOC2-aligned logging in project controllers, encrypted transport for workspace mutations, and auditable role gating through `useProjectManagementAccess` before expanding access to new cohorts.
   - *Accessibility.* Validate semantic structure (e.g., list roles, labelled buttons, aria-describedby wiring in `ProjectOpportunityCard.jsx`) against WCAG 2.2 AA and ensure keyboard-only users can traverse listings and workspace tabs.
   - *Competitive Benchmark.* Benchmark hero metrics, auto-match analytics, and workspace instrumentation against executive networks (LinkedIn, AngelList, Toptal) to prioritise parity gaps and differentiators.
   - *Future Readiness.* Stress future roadmap items (advanced analytics overlays, AI summarisation, cross-program launches) against current component boundaries so upcoming capabilities extend without rewrites.
   - *Frontend Surface.* Validate `ProjectsPage.jsx` skeleton loaders, radial-gradient hero, and responsive breakpoints in `AppLayout` deliver premium first impressions on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
   - *Backend Foundation.* Inspect `projectController.js` and `projectService.js` for predictable retries, transactional safety around auto-assign, and dependency injection so burst traffic does not degrade stability.
   - *Data & Analytics.* Trace queue metrics, velocity aggregations, and workspace telemetry from Sequelize models through `fetchProjectAutoAssignMetrics` to ensure dashboards and reporting stay in sync.
   - *UX & Brand.* Compare iconography, gradient treatments, and glassmorphism cards to leading professional networks, ensuring Gigvora’s brand voice feels trustworthy and modern.
2. **Functionality.** The React front door now composes projects with reusable cards, aggregated statistics, and responsive semantics. `ProjectsPage.jsx` orchestrates listing fetches via `useOpportunityListing` and cached auto-match metrics through `useCachedResource`, then renders each initiative through the accessible `ProjectOpportunityCard.jsx`. Detail and management surfaces (`ProjectDetailPage.jsx`, `ProjectWorkspaceSection.jsx`, `ProjectWorkspaceContainer.jsx`, `ProjectWorkspaceModule.jsx`) manage queues, milestones, budgets, submissions, HR, and messaging. Admin draw downs reuse `ProjectWorkspaceDrawer.jsx` to edit workspace data, while services in `projects.js` and `projectService.js` expose CRUD, auto-assign toggles, events, and workspace actions. QA matrices should exercise route transitions, optimistic updates, skeleton states, offline fallbacks, and cron refreshes that keep metrics live across personas.
   - *Service Contracts.* Document request/response contracts for controllers and `projects.js` helpers (workspace CRUD, auto-assign toggles, event streams) including status codes and envelope shapes.
   - *State Persistence.* Verify listing filters, drafts, and workspace edits persist via secure storage, cached resources, or server snapshots to prevent churn when switching tabs or reloading.
   - *Notifications.* Trace how auto-match events, workspace submissions, and approvals emit in-app, email, and push signals without duplication.
   - *Lifecycle Hooks.* Catalogue cron schedules and queue refresh triggers (auto-assign regeneration, queue metrics TTL) to guarantee freshness and detect lag.
   - *User Journeys.* Map entry points (public listing, deep-linked detail routes, admin drawers, dashboard shortcuts) and ensure validation, error recovery, and success confirmations read clearly across devices.
   - *System Integrations.* Enumerate dependencies on auto-assign workers, analytics pipelines, escrow integrations, and calendar services so sequencing and failure modes stay predictable.
   - *Edge Conditions.* Simulate slow networks, empty queue states, expired sessions, and restricted roles to confirm the UI degrades gracefully with helpful messaging.
   - *Cross-Platform.* Align gestures, caching, and haptics between web and Flutter, especially for workspace tabs, queue toggles, and messaging to deliver consistent muscle memory.
3. **Logic Usefulness.** Business logic links listing analytics, workspace governance, and payment triggers. `projectService.js` normalises fairness weights, queue windows, and median response analytics, while `projects.js` client helpers enforce request validation. Detail pages surface status, budgets, weights, and queue activity that operations rely on to coordinate escrow milestones and staffing. Reviews must verify feature flags, decision trees, and computed properties map directly to persona needs, with fallbacks and audit trails enabling reversibility when compliance teams review actions.
   - *Personalisation.* Ensure auto-match fairness and queue descriptions reflect role, cohort, and newcomer guarantees without bias.
   - *Conflict Resolution.* Confirm concurrency guards in controllers prevent conflicting edits across workspace tabs or double queue runs.
   - *Scenario Coverage.* Stress high-volume hiring campaigns, simultaneous workspace edits, and rapid queue regeneration to verify logical resilience.
   - *Data Provenance.* Surface source-of-truth indicators (timestamps, queue counts, fairness limits) within cards and workspace tabs so executives trust decisions.
   - *Decision Trees.* Document feature flags, access checks, and gating logic that toggle management tools, admin drawers, or metrics visibility.
   - *Business Alignment.* Tie analytics (velocity, completion rate, fairness adoption) to KPIs for mentor matching, hiring velocity, and program growth.
   - *Observability.* Confirm logging, metrics, and traces explain why auto-assign toggled or workspace mutations occurred, supporting audits.
   - *Recovery Paths.* Validate error boundaries and fallback banners for metrics load failures, workspace save errors, or queue regeneration hiccups.
4. **Redundancies.** The new `ProjectOpportunityCard.jsx` consolidates listing markup previously duplicated inside `ProjectsPage.jsx`. Continue cataloguing redundant workspace drawers, tab panels, or helper utilities so teams reuse canonical implementations. Merge overlapping deliverable schemas across gig and project services, dedupe queue analytics helpers, and align workspace tab forms so budgets, roles, submissions, and meetings share consistent field logic.
   - *Dependency Graph.* Visualise React modules, hooks, and services to spot overlapping imports between listing, detail, and admin experiences.
   - *Documentation.* Update handbooks so product, success, and operations teams reference the same card component and workspace taxonomy.
   - *Design Tokens.* Centralise gradients, radii, and badge styles introduced in cards into shared tokens to avoid drift.
   - *Analytics Events.* Merge event names tracking joins, auto-match toggles, and workspace edits to simplify dashboards.
   - *Code Review.* Enforce that new listing treatments extend `ProjectOpportunityCard.jsx` rather than re-implement markup.
   - *Schema Review.* Align deliverable, submission, and milestone schemas across gig/project domains to eliminate parallel data stores.
   - *UI Audit.* Remove legacy cards that lack analytics badges or fairness copy so the new component remains the single source of truth.
   - *Process Review.* Assign ownership for listing, detail, and workspace modules to prevent parallel feature branches.
5. **Placeholders or non-working functions or stubs.** Replace any remaining course or scholarship copy with accurate messaging. Ensure analytics sections never render placeholder text, workspace drawers do not expose TODO states, and tests reference real data. Stubs in `projects.js` or workspace tabs should call backend services, and storybook/demo data must mimic realistic payloads to avoid regressions when hooking to production.
   - *Feature Flags.* Inventory temporary toggles (e.g., new workspace modules) and schedule clean-up once production-ready.
   - *Testing Coverage.* Add integration tests for the new card semantics, ensuring analytics badges and aria wiring stay intact.
   - *Docs & Training.* Update support runbooks describing new listing layout and analytics to remove placeholder instructions.
   - *Data Migration.* Backfill queue metrics and fairness settings for older projects so badges never display empty placeholders.
   - *Code Flags.* Eliminate TODO branches referencing deprecated listing markup.
   - *Data Seeds.* Ensure fixtures for unit tests (workspace tabs, listing cards) contain realistic taxonomy labels and auto-match data.
   - *UI States.* Replace any lorem ipsum or blank modules in workspace tabs with actual descriptions, fallback illustrations, or informative messaging.
   - *Operational Hooks.* Confirm auto-assign cron jobs and analytics refresh tasks are active in staging and production so cards surface live data.
6. **Duplicate Functions.** The card refactor removed duplicated badge and queue markup from `ProjectsPage.jsx`, but further consolidation is needed. Align analytics formatting helpers, fairness descriptions, and queue status formatters across listing, detail, and workspace modules. Consolidate repeated workspace tab utilities (budget normalisation, meeting scheduling, HR record formatting) into shared helpers to prevent divergence.
   - *GraphQL/REST Normalisation.* Ensure listing and detail endpoints share transformation logic so statuses, limits, and queue timestamps render consistently.
   - *Styling Utils.* Share gradient, shadow, and border utilities between cards, hero stats, and admin drawers.
   - *Mobile Parity.* Mirror card behaviour inside Flutter listing modules to avoid drift.
   - *Domain Events.* Standardise analytics events triggered when users join, manage, or auto-match a project.
   - *Service Layer.* Merge overlapping workspace service calls (brief, budgets, objects) so both company and agency dashboards hit the same helper functions.
   - *Client Utilities.* Centralise fetch/update wrappers in `projects.js` to avoid duplicating request code across dashboards.
   - *Notification Templates.* Reuse messaging templates (queue regenerated, approval submitted) to keep tone consistent.
   - *Testing Utilities.* Deduplicate mocks for workspace tabs and queue metrics so tests align with production shapes.
7. **Improvements to make.** Ship enhancements that elevate polish and reduce cognitive load. Recent changes introduced reusable cards with better semantics; next we should implement contextual quick actions, inline queue analytics, and richer workspace summaries. Prioritise backlog items that boost discovery (saved filters, persona presets), streamline operations (bulk queue actions, workspace diffing), and surface strategic context (in-card milestones, budget burn-downs).
   - *Platform Alignment.* Coordinate with analytics and messaging squads so telemetry and notifications arrive alongside new UI.
   - *User Research.* Validate card microcopy, fairness explanations, and CTA placement through qualitative research.
   - *Documentation.* Update README and internal onboarding to highlight the new card architecture and accessible markup.
   - *Budgeting.* Forecast headcount and infra needs for upcoming workspace automation features.
   - *Technical Roadmap.* Schedule refactors for shared workspace tab helpers and queue analytics caching.
   - *Experience Enhancements.* Add quick filter chips, inline auto-match toggles, and contextual tooltips without increasing clutter.
   - *Design Evolution.* Partner with design to extend gradients, shadows, and typography tokens across admin dashboards.
   - *Measurement.* Attach analytics to new card interactions and workspace tabs to confirm adoption.
8. **Styling improvements.** Preserve the gradient hero and glassmorphism cards while tightening typography and spacing. Extend brand gradients to admin drawers, adopt consistent radii and shadow tokens from `ProjectOpportunityCard.jsx`, and ensure workspace tabs harmonise with the listing aesthetic. Document dark mode behaviour, focus outlines, and hover/pressed states so other squads adopt the same premium look.
   - *Component Library.* Promote the card styling into shared kits for reuse.
   - *Microstates.* Expand hover/focus/disabled variants for badges, join buttons, and admin links.
   - *Sound & Haptics.* Define subtle audio or vibration cues for queue toggles on mobile.
   - *Illustrations.* Commission supporting visuals for empty states (no projects, auto-match inactive).
   - *Component Styling.* Align font weights, line heights, and border radii across listing, detail, and admin surfaces.
   - *Theme Consistency.* Ensure dark, high-contrast, and brand variants exist for cards and workspace panels.
   - *Motion Design.* Tune hover elevation and route transitions to feel confident without being distracting.
   - *Brand Expression.* Use gradients, micro-glow, and iconography that reinforce Gigvora’s mentor-first identity.
9. **Efficiency analysis and improvement.** Audit re-render patterns post-refactor. `ProjectOpportunityCard.jsx` memoises taxonomy tags and collaborator avatars; ensure listing fetches batch network calls and that metrics caching uses TTLs (`METRICS_CACHE_KEY`). Profile workspace tabs for virtualization opportunities, and stress-test auto-match analytics to confirm caches invalidate on mutations.
   - *Caching Strategy.* Validate TTL configuration for cached metrics and listing queries.
   - *Data Volume Tests.* Load large project sets to ensure virtualization or pagination keeps cards responsive.
   - *Resource Footprint.* Monitor CPU/memory for controllers handling queue regeneration and workspace mutations.
   - *Cost Optimisation.* Evaluate auto-match analytics refresh cost and consider batching or streaming.
   - *Frontend Performance.* Profile card render costs and hero metric updates; leverage memoization and `useId` responsibly.
   - *Backend Performance.* Tune SQL joins in `projectService.js` and ensure indexes support queue analytics.
   - *Realtime Efficiency.* Validate socket throughput and fan-out for auto-match events.
   - *Operational Efficiency.* Automate alerts when metrics caches lag or queue regeneration stalls.
10. **Strengths to keep.** Preserve the premium storytelling: gradient hero, aggregated queue analytics, fairness badges, and workspace modules that communicate governance. Highlight positive feedback on auto-match transparency, aggregated stats, and accessible markup so future iterations retain the trust-building elements.
   - *Cultural Fit.* Gather testimonials from program managers praising the improved listing clarity.
   - *Reusable Patterns.* Encourage other squads to adopt the card’s aria patterns, gradient treatment, and badge styling.
   - *Data Partnerships.* Maintain integrations with auto-assign metrics, escrow, and analytics pipelines.
   - *Team Rituals.* Continue QA playbooks that capture screenshots across breakpoints.
   - *Signature Moments.* Keep fairness explanations, queue cadence blurbs, and aggregated stats front-and-centre.
   - *Architectural Wins.* Preserve modular services and hooks for reuse in dashboards.
   - *Data Quality.* Keep validation and deduplication pipelines feeding metrics accurate.
   - *Operational Excellence.* Maintain monitoring dashboards and on-call rotation for project services.
11. **Weaknesses to remove.** Address outstanding gaps: missing quick actions for managers, limited persona presets, and inconsistent admin drawers. Eliminate any AI placeholder copy, tighten spacing inconsistencies, and reduce dependency duplication in workspace tabs. Prioritise compliance checks around queue edits and ensure analytics fail gracefully.
   - *Escalation History.* Review tickets related to workspace save errors or queue toggles.
   - *Shadow IT.* Identify spreadsheets or side tools teams use for milestone tracking and fold needs into the product.
   - *Data Hygiene.* Clean stale queue stats and update fairness settings for legacy projects.
   - *Change Drift.* Keep Figma specs and code in lockstep after introducing the new card.
   - *User Pain.* Track survey feedback on workspace complexity or listing discoverability.
   - *Technical Debt.* Retire redundant workspace tab components and update tests to cover new semantics.
   - *Design Debt.* Resolve misaligned badges, inconsistent paddings, and text hierarchy gaps.
   - *Risk Exposure.* Conduct accessibility and privacy reviews when expanding analytics or workspace exports.
12. **Styling and colour review changes.** Extend palette tokens to highlight fairness, velocity, and access states. Harmonise card and hero colours with brand accents, ensure badge contrasts meet WCAG, and document light/dark variants for workspace drawers.
   - *Gradient Usage.* Define when to use radial hero gradients vs. subtle card glows.
   - *Accessibility Themes.* Provide high-contrast overrides for analytics badges and CTA buttons.
   - *Brand Motion.* Align hover transitions and shimmering cards with Gigvora’s motion guidelines.
   - *Print/PDF Modes.* Ensure exported briefs and listings keep colour fidelity.
   - *Palette Calibration.* Map gradient stops and accent shades to design tokens.
   - *Component Themes.* Sync badge colours between listing cards and workspace tabs.
   - *Contrast Testing.* Run audits on fairness copy, queue badges, and hero metrics.
   - *Visual Hierarchy.* Use colour to differentiate management vs. join actions without overwhelming users.
13. **CSS, orientation, placement and arrangement changes.** Continue refining responsive layouts. The new card renders inside an ordered list with `role="list"`; ensure spacing, alignment, and sticky modules adapt gracefully across viewports. Document layout grids for hero metrics, card stacks, and workspace tabs so other teams reuse the blueprint.
   - *Micro-layouts.* Audit nested flex and grid usage to maintain clarity.
   - *Scroll Behaviour.* Define how metric banners, filters, and cards behave on scroll.
   - *Composability.* Allow downstream teams to extend cards with optional slots (e.g., quick actions, persona tags).
   - *Hardware Diversity.* Test keyboard, mouse, and touch interactions for join buttons and admin links.
   - *Layout Systems.* Align cards to spacing tokens (8/12/16px) across breakpoints.
   - *Orientation Support.* Confirm landscape/portrait transitions keep hero metrics legible.
   - *Interaction Zones.* Maintain generous click/tap areas for badges and CTAs.
   - *Internationalisation.* Validate long titles, translated badges, and RTL support within cards and tabs.
14. **Text analysis, placement, length, redundancy, quality.** Review hero copy, fairness explanations, and queue descriptions for clarity and brevity. Replace generic phrasing with outcome-driven messaging (“Enable auto-match to rotate curated freelancers”) and ensure repeated text (e.g., queue size) remains purposeful across card and detail sections.
   - *Narrative Balance.* Keep hero statements aspirational yet specific—spotlight auto-match velocity, newcomer guarantees, and governance transparency.
   - *Analytics Clarity.* Ensure queue badges, fairness cards, and workspace summaries call out metrics with consistent casing and units.
   - *Persona Targeting.* Tailor copy variants for mentors, agencies, and founders while keeping translations concise.
   - *Governance Tone.* Audit admin drawer labels so compliance messaging feels confident and calm rather than punitive.
15. **Text spacing.** Codify typographic rhythm across listings and workspace modules. `ProjectOpportunityCard.jsx` relies on `mt-3`, `mt-5`, and `gap-4` utilities; the hero block in `ProjectsPage.jsx` mixes `p-6`, `px-6`, and `py-20`. Align these increments to the 4/8pt baseline so cards breathe without feeling sparse.
   - *Scale Map.* Document which Tailwind classes map to the baseline grid, ensuring `p-6` pairs with `mt-3`/`mt-5` spacing and that detail pages mirror the same rhythm.
   - *Responsive Rhythm.* Validate that `sm:grid-cols-2` panels maintain comfortable line heights on tablets; introduce breakpoint-specific `space-y-*` tokens if columns stack.
   - *Copy Blocks.* Limit paragraph width in descriptions (e.g., clamp to 65ch) and apply consistent `leading-relaxed` vs. `leading-snug` choices based on surface density.
   - *Workspace Alignment.* Sync drawer content padding with listing cards so users feel a seamless transition when managing details.
16. **Shaping.** Standardise curvature across the opportunity ecosystem. Listing cards use `rounded-3xl`, the hero CTA block uses `rounded-4xl`, and pills/buttons use `rounded-full`; define when each applies and ensure workspace modals reflect the same tokens.
   - *Card Radii.* Keep primary cards at `rounded-3xl` and extend to detail summaries so previews and deep dives feel related.
   - *Panel Geometry.* Align hero stat containers (`rounded-3xl` with `shadow-inner`) and workspace drawers to avoid mixed visual languages.
   - *Pill Treatments.* Ensure all chips, badges, and CTAs use consistent `rounded-full` radii with matching border widths.
   - *Mobile Considerations.* Validate that large radii do not clip on small screens; adjust padding to preserve silhouette integrity.
17. **Shadow, hover, glow and effects.** Elevate interactions without sacrificing clarity. `ProjectOpportunityCard.jsx` applies `hover:-translate-y-0.5`, `hover:border-accent/60`, and `hover:shadow-soft`; stats panels blend `shadow-soft` with `shadow-inner`.
   - *Elevation Scale.* Document base vs. hover vs. focus shadows so cards, drawers, and dialogs follow the same progression.
   - *Focus Visibility.* Pair shadows with outline treatments to satisfy accessibility requirements for keyboard users.
   - *Motion Tuning.* Calibrate hover transitions (180–220ms) and translation distances so they feel premium but not distracting.
   - *Glow Guidelines.* Reserve glow effects for premium states (e.g., queue enabled) and ensure they respect dark mode.
18. **Thumbnails.** Avatar clusters power credibility in both listings and hero CTAs via `UserAvatar`.
   - *Seed Strategy.* Confirm collaborator avatars use deterministic seeds (`project.id`) so surfaces remain stable between reloads.
   - *Quantity Rules.* Cap inline avatars at three with `-space-x-3` overlap; overflow should switch to numeric indicators in future enhancements.
   - *Fallback Assets.* Provide branded initials or illustrations when avatars fail to load, matching the card’s neutral palette.
   - *Workspace Cohesion.* Mirror avatar treatments inside `ProjectWorkspaceModule.jsx` participant lists for continuity.
19. **Images and media & Images and media previews.** Projects lean on gradients, avatars, and potential asset previews.
   - *Hero Canvas.* Maintain the radial gradient backdrop defined in `ProjectsPage.jsx` and ensure dark-mode equivalents avoid banding.
   - *Media Slots.* Plan for optional project thumbnails or video loops within cards; define aspect ratios (16:9, 4:3) and safe zones.
   - *Loading Strategy.* Lazy-load heavy media while preserving skeletons so layout shifts stay minimal.
   - *Fallback Storytelling.* Provide illustrated placeholders for projects lacking media, matching LinkedIn/Dribbble polish.
20. **Button styling.** Cards mix `Link` components and buttons with `rounded-full` treatments.
   - *Primary vs. Secondary.* Define token pairs for solid, outline, and dashed variants used for join, manage, and locked states.
   - *Iconography.* Standardise arrow glyph sizing and spacing inside inline-flex buttons.
   - *State Matrix.* Document hover, focus, disabled, and loading visuals so auto-match toggles feel consistent across surfaces.
   - *Accessibility.* Ensure minimum hit area (44px) and maintain `aria-describedby` wiring for context-driven buttons like join.
21. **Interactiveness.** Projects experience spans analytics refreshes, join flows, and admin actions.
   - *CTA Wiring.* Ensure `onJoin` handlers trigger analytics (`analytics.track('web_project_join_cta', ...)`) and gracefully handle disabled states.
   - *Role Gating.* Keep `useProjectManagementAccess` logic surfaced via management badges with clear copy for denied roles.
   - *Keyboard Flow.* Verify list items, buttons, and drawers maintain logical tab order with `aria-labelledby` and `aria-describedby` hooks.
   - *Realtime Feedback.* Surface toasts or banners when queue regeneration or workspace saves complete to reinforce responsiveness.
22. **Missing Components.** Identify gaps holding the experience back from enterprise parity.
   - *Filter Systems.* Introduce saved filter chips, persona presets, and sort controls to complement `MarketplaceSearchInput`.
   - *Quick Actions.* Add inline actions (star, share, duplicate brief) within cards without overwhelming layout density.
   - *Workspace Timeline.* Provide a unified activity feed inside `ProjectWorkspaceSection.jsx` summarising approvals, payments, and queue runs.
   - *Analytics Overlays.* Layer trend charts or benchmark comparisons above listings for operators and executives.
23. **Design Changes.** Plan structural evolutions based on roadmap priorities.
   - *Adaptive Cards.* Explore expandable card sections revealing milestones, budget burn-down, or talent mix without navigation.
   - *Persona Modes.* Offer curated layouts for agencies vs. founders, controlling which metrics or actions appear by default.
   - *Admin Drawer Refresh.* Refine `ProjectWorkspaceDrawer.jsx` with tabbed inputs, contextual help, and embedded analytics.
   - *Mobile First.* Prototype stacked card layouts with sticky action bars to match Instagram-grade mobile polish.
24. **Design Duplication.** Prevent drift as teams scale the opportunity ecosystem.
   - *Shared Tokens.* Promote gradients, pill borders, and typography scales into the design system so squads reuse them.
   - *Component Registry.* Register `ProjectOpportunityCard` and workspace panels in Storybook with usage notes to avoid forked variants.
   - *Pattern Governance.* Host regular design reviews ensuring new surfaces extend, rather than duplicate, existing patterns.
   - *Docs Sync.* Keep design specs, code comments, and product briefs aligned to avoid parallel interpretations of the card.
25. **Design framework.** Anchor projects surfaces inside Gigvora’s enterprise design system.
   - *Token Mapping.* Tie spacing, colour, and motion tokens in `ProjectOpportunityCard.jsx` and `ProjectsPage.jsx` to canonical names.
   - *Responsive Specs.* Provide breakpoint matrices showing how hero stats, cards, and drawers reflow from widescreen dashboards to mobile.
   - *Accessibility Charter.* Publish rules covering focus order, aria usage, and reduced-motion alternatives across listing and workspace modules.
   - *Governance.* Define ownership rituals (design crits, UI council reviews) to keep projects aligned with cross-product storytelling.
26. **Change checklist tracker.** Track the card refactor and upcoming workspace improvements with a structured change log: consolidate schemas, retire stubs, refresh styling, and run QA on listing, detail, and workspace flows. Capture dependencies (analytics updates, workspace service changes) and secure cross-functional sign-off.
   - *Risk Management.* Schedule privacy and security reviews before rolling out new analytics or role gating.
   - *Rollout Strategy.* Plan staged releases (internal beta, agency cohort, full network) with telemetry checkpoints.
