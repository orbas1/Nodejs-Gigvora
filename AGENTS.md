1. Appraisal. gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/pages/dashboards/AgencyClientKanbanPage.jsx currently the client kanban workspace mapping onboarding through delivery, yet the experience drifts from the LinkedIn-level polish the redesign targets; document existing widgets, data dependencies, and pain points before rebuilding.
2. Functionality. gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/pages/dashboards/AgencyClientKanbanPage.jsx must deliver reliable flows for the client kanban workspace mapping onboarding through delivery, tying UI events to resilient API contracts with optimistic updates and undo states.
3. Logic Usefulness. Audit business rules inside gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/pages/dashboards/AgencyClientKanbanPage.jsx so only logic that advances the client kanban workspace mapping onboarding through delivery remains; deprecate vanity metrics or redundant branching.
4. Redundancies. Compare gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/pages/dashboards/AgencyClientKanbanPage.jsx against sibling modules to eliminate duplicated fetches, context providers, or layout wrappers around the client kanban workspace mapping onboarding through delivery.
5. Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs. Replace every placeholder, TODO, or dead tab in gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/pages/dashboards/AgencyClientKanbanPage.jsx with production-ready experiences aligned to the client kanban workspace mapping onboarding through delivery or cut the surface entirely.
6. Duplicate Functions. Merge repeated helpers inside gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/pages/dashboards/AgencyClientKanbanPage.jsx into shared hooks or utilities so the client kanban workspace mapping onboarding through delivery consumes one canonical toolkit.
7. Improvements need to make. Draft a mini spec for gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/pages/dashboards/AgencyClientKanbanPage.jsx covering data contracts, state diagrams, analytics, and accessibility acceptance criteria tailored to the client kanban workspace mapping onboarding through delivery.
