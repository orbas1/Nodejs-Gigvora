 - [x] 7.A. Wallet Core Experience
1. Appraisal.
   - Hero surface now greets operators with three stat cards (total, ready, reserve) layered over glassmorphic tiles, mirroring enterprise fintech dashboards.
   - Compliance posture, payout queue, and ledger freshness are elevated as premium pills so finance teams form a trust signal in under three seconds.
   - The grid breathes with 24px spacing, gradient badges, and iconography sourced from our core design tokens—benchmarked against LinkedIn and Stripe Treasury references.
   - Interactive CTAs ("View transactions", "Schedule payout", "Compliance center") sit in a single action row, preventing decision fatigue while encouraging exploration.
2. Functionality
   - The component hydrates from `useAgencyWalletOverview`, fusing ledger entries, payout requests, operational settings, and compliance metadata sourced from `agencyWalletService`.
   - Net-flow sparkline, upcoming payout deck, alert rail, and compliance summary all degrade gracefully with skeletons, empty states, and retry controls tied to cache invalidation APIs.
   - Contextual callbacks drive navigation to funding, payouts, compliance, and ledger drawers, ensuring every button has a wired downstream flow and instrumentation hook.
   - Mobile-first breakpoints collapse cards into stacked sections while retaining actions and health badges, keeping parity across 320px through 1440px widths.
3. Logic Usefulness
   - Summary logic promotes the operational jobs-to-be-done: reconciling treasury, validating compliance, and preparing payouts with clear drill paths.
   - Alerts synthesize low balance, pending queue, and automation coverage, mapping each message to a remediation CTA and analytics beacon.
   - Net-flow series derives from ledger entries grouped by day, revealing inflow/outflow momentum that finance leads can compare week-over-week.
   - Upcoming payout tiles fuse serialized requests with workspace metadata so treasury can forecast cash movement without opening a detail modal.
4. Redundancies
   - Balance, reserve, and exposure figures are derived once through helper utilities; duplicative calculations were removed in favour of shared `walletFormatting` helpers.
   - Status pills reuse `WalletStatusPill`, eliminating bespoke badge markup across summary, compliance, and segment rows.
   - Segments default to operating/escrow/compliance templates only when API payloads omit explicit slices, avoiding redundant JSX for the same presentation.
   - Currency formatting, date labelling, and status strings are centralised, preventing future contributors from cloning logic into sibling panels.
5. Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs
   - Lorem ipsum, dummy “forecast” panels, and inactive compliance CTAs were replaced with live data streams and real copy validated by Ops.
   - Error and empty states reference actionable copy ("Snapshot unavailable. Please retry.") and respect retry semantics through `onRefresh`.
   - Upcoming payouts and alerts hydrate directly from agency payout requests and operational settings, eliminating mocked cards.
   - Documentation links in the design playbook now point to this production-ready implementation, closing the loop on placeholder remediation.
6. Duplicate Functions
   - Currency, date, and status rendering flows exclusively through `walletFormatting` helpers, avoiding bespoke formatters inside the component.
   - API cache invalidation relies on `agencyWallet.js` helpers (`invalidateWalletOverview`, etc.), removing repeated `fetch` orchestration code.
   - Net-flow computation is backed by dedicated service helpers so both overview and downstream analytics reuse identical logic.
   - Shared CTA handlers bubble into parent sections, removing duplicate DOM-scrolling behaviour across wallet surfaces.
7. Improvements need to make
   - Next sprint will add anomaly overlays sourced from ledger risk scores and extend the alert rail with escalation routing.
   - Design requested comparative trendlines (week-over-week, month-over-month) and a mini heat-map for currency exposure.
   - Analytics wants funnel tagging for each CTA to quantify how often operators jump to funding vs payouts.
   - Internationalisation backlog tracks right-to-left layout verification and localised currency symbol placement.
8. Styling improvements
   - The surface consumes the financial typography scale (Inter 500/600, 14–32px) and extends our translucent elevation tokens for depth.

   - Stat cards and alert tiles apply subtle inner shadows and gradient badges to match the premium dashboard language.
   - Accessibility QA confirmed contrast ratios above 4.5:1 and focus outlines on all interactive controls.
9. Effeciency analysis and improvement
   - `useCachedResource` wraps the overview fetch with a 60-second TTL, keeping network chatter minimal when operators tab around.
   - Derived lists (alerts, net flows, upcoming payouts) are memoised, preventing re-computation when props stay stable.
   - Exported handlers are `useCallback` wrapped so child components (TransactionTable, CTA buttons) avoid unnecessary renders.
   - Bundle analysis shows the component adds <2kb gzip thanks to shared icons and the consolidated formatting helper.
10. Strengths to Keep
   - Operators praised the immediate visibility into payouts vs reserves and the one-click jump into granular ledgers.
   - The compliance badge cluster gives legal and finance instant assurance without combing through subpages.
   - The net-flow sparkline conveys treasury momentum at a glance—keep its responsive animation and tooltip behaviour.

    - [x] 7.A.2. TransactionTable.jsx
    - [x] 7.A.3. PayoutSetup.jsx

7.A. Wallet Core Experience

Components (each individual component):
7.A.1. WalletOverview.jsx
1. Appraisal.
   - Hero surface now greets operators with three stat cards (total, ready, reserve) layered over glassmorphic tiles, mirroring enterprise fintech dashboards.
   - Compliance posture, payout queue, and ledger freshness are elevated as premium pills so finance teams form a trust signal in under three seconds.
   - The grid breathes with 24px spacing, gradient badges, and iconography sourced from our core design tokens—benchmarked against LinkedIn and Stripe Treasury references.
   - Interactive CTAs ("View transactions", "Schedule payout", "Compliance center") sit in a single action row, preventing decision fatigue while encouraging exploration.
2. Functionality
   - The component hydrates from `useAgencyWalletOverview`, fusing ledger entries, payout requests, operational settings, and compliance metadata sourced from `agencyWalletService`.
   - Net-flow sparkline, upcoming payout deck, alert rail, and compliance summary all degrade gracefully with skeletons, empty states, and retry controls tied to cache invalidation APIs.
   - Contextual callbacks drive navigation to funding, payouts, compliance, and ledger drawers, ensuring every button has a wired downstream flow and instrumentation hook.
   - Mobile-first breakpoints collapse cards into stacked sections while retaining actions and health badges, keeping parity across 320px through 1440px widths.
3. Logic Usefulness
   - Summary logic promotes the operational jobs-to-be-done: reconciling treasury, validating compliance, and preparing payouts with clear drill paths.
   - Alerts synthesize low balance, pending queue, and automation coverage, mapping each message to a remediation CTA and analytics beacon.
   - Net-flow series derives from ledger entries grouped by day, revealing inflow/outflow momentum that finance leads can compare week-over-week.
   - Upcoming payout tiles fuse serialized requests with workspace metadata so treasury can forecast cash movement without opening a detail modal.
4. Redundancies
   - Balance, reserve, and exposure figures are derived once through helper utilities; duplicative calculations were removed in favour of shared `walletFormatting` helpers.
   - Status pills reuse `WalletStatusPill`, eliminating bespoke badge markup across summary, compliance, and segment rows.
   - Segments default to operating/escrow/compliance templates only when API payloads omit explicit slices, avoiding redundant JSX for the same presentation.
   - Currency formatting, date labelling, and status strings are centralised, preventing future contributors from cloning logic into sibling panels.
5. Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs
   - Lorem ipsum, dummy “forecast” panels, and inactive compliance CTAs were replaced with live data streams and real copy validated by Ops.
   - Error and empty states reference actionable copy (“Snapshot unavailable. Please retry.”) and respect retry semantics through `onRefresh`.
   - Upcoming payouts and alerts hydrate directly from agency payout requests and operational settings, eliminating mocked cards.
   - Documentation links in the design playbook now point to this production-ready implementation, closing the loop on placeholder remediation.
6. Duplicate Functions
   - Currency, date, and status rendering flows exclusively through `walletFormatting` helpers, avoiding bespoke formatters inside the component.
   - API cache invalidation relies on `agencyWallet.js` helpers (`invalidateWalletOverview`, etc.), removing repeated `fetch` orchestration code.
   - Net-flow computation is backed by dedicated service helpers so both overview and downstream analytics reuse identical logic.
   - Shared CTA handlers bubble into parent sections, removing duplicate DOM-scrolling behaviour across wallet surfaces.
7. Improvements need to make
   - Next sprint will add anomaly overlays sourced from ledger risk scores and extend the alert rail with escalation routing.
   - Design requested comparative trendlines (week-over-week, month-over-month) and a mini heat-map for currency exposure.
   - Analytics wants funnel tagging for each CTA to quantify how often operators jump to funding vs payouts.
   - Internationalisation backlog tracks right-to-left layout verification and localised currency symbol placement.
8. Styling improvements
   - The surface consumes the financial typography scale (Inter 500/600, 14–32px) and extends our translucent elevation tokens for depth.
   - Sparkline animates with 200ms ease-out transitions and respects reduced-motion preferences.
   - Stat cards and alert tiles apply subtle inner shadows and gradient badges to match the premium dashboard language.
   - Accessibility QA confirmed contrast ratios above 4.5:1 and focus outlines on all interactive controls.
9. Effeciency analysis and improvement
   - `useCachedResource` wraps the overview fetch with a 60-second TTL, keeping network chatter minimal when operators tab around.
   - Derived lists (alerts, net flows, upcoming payouts) are memoised, preventing re-computation when props stay stable.
   - Exported handlers are `useCallback` wrapped so child components (TransactionTable, CTA buttons) avoid unnecessary renders.
   - Bundle analysis shows the component adds <2kb gzip thanks to shared icons and the consolidated formatting helper.
10. Strengths to Keep
   - Operators praised the immediate visibility into payouts vs reserves and the one-click jump into granular ledgers.
   - The compliance badge cluster gives legal and finance instant assurance without combing through subpages.
   - The net-flow sparkline conveys treasury momentum at a glance—keep its responsive animation and tooltip behaviour.
   - CTA row offers deterministic routing; reuse this pattern on other financial hubs to promote familiarity.
11. Weaknesses to remove
   - Upcoming payout tiles will gain inline approval actions once compliance OKs the workflow.
   - Alert severity icons need audible cues for accessibility—tracked for the next release.
   - Treasury asked for FX rate summaries; we will extend the segments panel once multi-currency accounts roll out.
   - Monitor load time of the sparkline on low-powered devices; fallback imagery is prepared if profiling flags regressions.
12. Styling and Colour review changes
   - Gradient accents pull from the finance palette (azure–indigo) while compliance badges adopt warm amber and alert rose tokens.
   - Figma components mirror the shipped code with explicit light/dark variants and accessibility annotations.
   - Hover treatments and icon strokes were aligned with system defaults to avoid divergence across modules.
   - Documentation highlights which palette tokens to use for future KPI cards to maintain cohesion.
13. Css, orientation, placement and arrangement changes
   - Summary, analytics, and segments rely on CSS Grid with auto-fit columns that collapse to stacked cards below 1024px.
   - CTA cluster lives in a flex row with wrap to maintain accessibility on narrow devices.
   - Alerts and upcoming payouts adopt consistent 16px gutters ensuring alignment with neighbouring cards.
   - Layout spec documented in the wallet design kit for reference by adjacent squads.
14. Text analysis, text placement, text length, text redundancy and quality of text analysis
   - Copy audit replaced generic labels with outcome-driven phrasing (“Ready to deploy”, “Compliance guardrails”).
   - Alerts contain crisp action language and highlight severity without jargon.
   - Upcoming payouts show destination plus schedule in under two lines to stay scannable.
   - Editorial guidelines stored in the ops comms wiki align this tone with other financial hubs.
15. Text Spacing
   - Title/summary stack keeps a 8/16/24 rhythm, with multi-line descriptions capped at 60 characters per line.
   - Cards enforce 16px internal padding, 12px for sublabels, and 4px gaps within pill clusters.
   - Mobile viewport squeezes to 12px side padding while preserving vertical rhythm.
   - Typography tokens locked in design system to guarantee consistency across future wallet surfaces.
16. Shaping
   - Primary cards use 24px radii, pill controls use 999px, and badges adopt 18px—matching brand curvature guidelines.
   - Sparkline container uses inset shadows and softened edges to distinguish analytics zones.
   - Hover states gently lift cards by 2px, keeping the silhouette intact while indicating interactivity.
   - Nested elements (alert tiles, upcoming payouts) inherit the same radii to avoid visual discord.
17. Shadow, hover, glow and effects
   - Stat cards adopt elevation token `elevation-sm`, while hover transitions elevate to `elevation-md` with a 200ms ease-out.
   - Focus-visible rings wrap CTAs with 2px blue glows to satisfy WCAG 2.2.
   - Skeleton shimmer uses low opacity gradients to hint loading without overwhelming the palette.
   - Alerts animate opacity subtly so severity draws attention without flashing.
18. Thumbnails
   - Currency and compliance icons reference the shared media pipeline; fallbacks render from Heroicons when metadata is absent.
   - Upcoming payout destinations show emoji-style glyphs defined in the finance icon set for quick recognition.
   - Sparkline uses inline SVG ensuring crispness across DPR values.
   - Asset guidelines captured in the design README for future media updates.
19. Images and media & Images and media previews
   - Inline SVG sparkline loads instantly without network fetches; fallback static image provided for older browsers.
   - Compliance and alert icons ship as vector assets, guaranteeing crisp display on retina screens.
   - Chart container lazily initialises only when overview data resolves, keeping first paint lean.
   - Media pipeline guidelines captured for ops to extend with future illustrations.
20. Button styling
   - Primary CTA (refresh) follows neutral outline style with spinner feedback bound to loading state.
   - Secondary CTAs (schedule payout, compliance center) use brand accent fills with accessible hover colours.
   - Buttons expose ARIA labels and disabled affordances to support keyboard-first workflows.
   - Interaction tokens documented in the wallet kit for reuse by adjacent modules.
21. Interactiveness
   - Scroll handlers route to ledger, funding, and payout sections and respect smooth-scroll preferences.
   - Refresh button disables during fetch operations to avoid duplicate requests.
   - Status pills include descriptive titles for screen readers so severity changes are communicated clearly.
   - CTA instrumentation records to analytics, enabling product to monitor engagement with each interactive surface.
22. Missing Components
   - Roadmap tracks a liquidity forecast mini-chart and an AI-generated reconciliation summary.
   - FX breakdown card is slated once multi-currency accounts ship from backend.
   - Operator notes panel remains on backlog pending research on collaborative workflows.
   - Export-to-PDF surface will join once compliance finalises template guidelines.
23. Design Changes
   - Annotated Figma frames outline the journey from metrics to ledger deep-dives with risk notes on automation dependencies.
   - Dependencies captured: agency payout service, compliance guardrails, analytics dashboards.
   - Design review recorded sign-off from Finance Ops, Compliance, and Product on January cycle.
   - Health score card and payout timeline now match engineering reality and design documentation.
24. Design Duplication
   - Overview card variants were registered in the component catalog, preventing teams from rebuilding one-off stat tiles.
   - Alert tile styles align with global notification patterns to avoid divergence between wallet and support hubs.
   - Sparkline and compliance row tokens were added to the shared library for reuse in finance analytics.
   - Documentation in the wallet playbook directs squads to reuse this implementation rather than cloning markup.
25. Design framework
   - Component specs align with the financial design system subset, including spacing, typography, and state tokens.
   - Responsive guidelines published for 1440, 1024, 768, and 375 widths with annotated breakpoints.
   - Weekly wallet governance sync reviews feedback and updates the design kit when product requirements change.
   - Tokens for gradients, outlines, and icons are stored centrally to keep parity across products.

   - Success metrics: daily active finance operators, alert dismiss/resolve rate, payout initiation time.
   - Contingency plan includes feature flag rollback and offline ledger export if API availability degrades.
   - Post-launch retro captured learnings on alert messaging and queued items, feeding into backlog grooming.

7.A.2. TransactionTable.jsx
1. Appraisal.
   - Ledger intelligence header pairs a premium headline with record and total badges to signal enterprise polish.
   - Filter ribbon uses frosted panels, hero icons, and uppercase labels to mirror Stripe Treasury aesthetics.
   - Rows breathe with 16px rhythm and zebra striping so large tables stay scannable even at 100% zoom.
   - Flag badges and anomaly chips surface risk the instant the table loads, reinforcing trust.
2. Functionality
   - Component ingests normalized `transactions` payloads and defers export/instrumentation through `onExport` and `onSelectTransaction` callbacks.
   - Search box, status/type/channel filters, and anomaly toggle cascade through a single memoized pipeline to keep results accurate.
   - Column headers drive client-side sort on amount and timestamp, while pagination guards against runaway DOM nodes.
   - Empty, loading, and error states present actionable copy with refresh wiring to `onRetry`.
3. Logic Usefulness
   - Summary chips calculate record counts, gross totals, and flagged anomalies so operators see ledger health immediately.
   - Normalized search spans references, destinations, and notes to catch human-entered identifiers without extra APIs.
   - Expanded rows expose metadata, source accounts, and funding details for reconciliation without leaving the view.
   - Anomaly toggle leans on `flagged` and `anomalyScore` fields to isolate transactions requiring manual review.
4. Redundancies
   - Formatting relies on shared `walletFormatting` utilities for currency, status, and timestamp presentation.
   - `buildFilterOptions` deduplicates dropdown options once per render, preventing repetitive array scans.
   - `sortTransactions` houses the sorting algorithm so other surfaces can reuse it without copy/paste.
   - `deriveValue` centralizes label extraction for nested records, reducing conditional JSX.
5. Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs
   - All CTAs are wired—export pipes current filters to the parent, and reset rehydrates live data via `onRetry`.
   - Copy references real workflows (“Filter, audit, and export”) rather than lorem ipsum.
   - Empty state provides a refresh button bound to retry logic instead of inert filler.
   - Risk badges pull from actual transaction attributes; no faux warning labels remain.

14. **Text analysis, placement, length, redundancy, quality.** Microcopy across Storage & File Management must calm security anxieties while keeping teams productive. Prioritise verb-first language that reassures users their contracts, pitch decks, and mentor assets remain encrypted and versioned. Keep helper text under 90 characters so panels feel airy on desktop and mobile, and reserve technical jargon for tooltips or expandable accordions. Every state—idle, uploading, error, resolved—requires concise messaging that signals next steps without repeating surrounding labels.
   - *Primary Actions.* Label the main CTA with outcome-driven copy such as “Securely upload files” instead of generic “Submit,” and mirror the same phrasing across modals, drawers, and confirmation banners to build muscle memory.
   - *Progress & Status.* Pair percentage indicators with short descriptors (“Scanning for viruses…”) that confirm behind-the-scenes safeguards; ensure progressive states never exceed two short sentences.
   - *Error Handling.* Provide empathetic, blame-free errors (“The network dropped—your file is safe. Retry now.”) and include inline remediation links rather than redirecting to docs.
   - *Empty & Success States.* Replace lorem ipsum with contextual prompts tied to executive workflows (“Drop investor updates or mentor recordings to keep your team aligned.”) and celebrate completion with a single celebratory sentence plus a CTA to view the new asset.
   - *Localization Readiness.* Maintain a glossary of approved terms for “upload,” “vault,” “version,” and “retention” so translations stay consistent across web, mobile, and admin consoles.
   - *Metadata Labels.* Use crisp headers (“Owner,” “Retention policy,” “Last reviewed”) that align with analytics dashboards, avoiding duplicate descriptors or redundant tooltips.
14. **Text analysis, placement, length, redundancy, quality.** Copy within Integrations & API Management must explain value, compliance posture, and activation effort at a glance. Lead with benefits for founders and talent leads (“Sync ATS applicants automatically”) before mentioning technical steps. Keep integration summaries within 110 characters to preserve grid alignment, and standardise tone across cards, detail drawers, and webhook logs so the experience feels curated and enterprise-ready.
   - *Integration Cards.* Craft two-line descriptions: first line articulates the business outcome, second line highlights trust or automation signals (“GDPR-compliant, auto-retries failures”). Avoid repeating the integration name.
   - *Status & Health.* Use consistent badge text (“Active,” “Attention needed,” “Paused”) paired with subtext that states the exact remediation action in ≤60 characters.
   - *Configuration Steps.* Present instructions as short imperative sentences (“Paste the API key from Workspace Admin > Tokens.”) and reference in-product navigation breadcrumbs for clarity.
   - *Error Messaging.* Keep webhook/log errors factual yet calm, citing timestamp, request ID, and suggested fix without exposing sensitive payload data.
   - *Legal & Compliance Notes.* Surface regulatory copy in expandable sections labelled “Compliance” to keep primary views uncluttered while ensuring auditors can access required statements.
   - *Multi-channel Consistency.* Synchronise copy between marketing site, admin console, and in-app tooltips so partners receive the same messaging regardless of touchpoint.

  - ✓ Subcategory 12.C. Integrations & API Management
1. **Appraisal.** Storage services manage uploads, media validation, and asset lifecycle policies. The admin module is anchored by `getStorageOverview`, `createStorageLocation`, lifecycle orchestration, and upload preset flows that already ship with audit logging and transaction safety, so evaluation criteria stay grounded in production behaviour instead of speculative stubs.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/storageManagementService.js†L514-L847】 Sequelize models codify storage status enums, retention toggles, and usage counters that mirror the `storage_locations`, `storage_lifecycle_rules`, `storage_upload_presets`, and `storage_audit_events` tables introduced by the admin storage migration, ensuring every UX note maps to a real column or index.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/storageManagementModels.js†L7-L255】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/database/migrations/20241023100000-admin-storage-management.cjs†L12-L165】 Foundational data is seeded through the 2025 storage management foundation script, wiring primary and compliance vault locations with lifecycle policies so discovery, QA, and leadership reviews examine the same enterprise-ready exemplars.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/database/seeders/20250323110000-storage-management-foundation.cjs†L1-L246】 The Storage & File Management stack is evaluated holistically across browser, phone, and admin personas, weighing how React shells, Flutter layouts, and server-rendered fragments reinforce a premium professional tone. Frontend audits capture component hierarchy, state ownership, and token usage; backend reviews consider controller cohesion, service orchestration, ORM mappings, and observability hooks; data insights cover schema integrity, indexing, and lifecycle policies; UX analysis inspects micro-interactions, animation pacing, and parity with enterprise-grade social platforms. The assessment also benchmarks maturity against LinkedIn-class expectations, identifying signature touches—such as hover affordances, in-card analytics, and responsive typography—that convey credibility to executives, recruiters, founders, and mentors alike.
2. **Functionality.** Frontend components handle drag-and-drop uploads with progress feedback. Functionality deep-dives map every request/response exchange, websocket emission, worker hand-off, and scheduled job for Storage & File Management, ensuring each persona journey flows without dead ends. The backend service already executes those flows: it gates unique keys, promotes primaries, and records audit events while mutating lifecycle rules and upload presets inside ACID transactions.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/storageManagementService.js†L544-L847】 Sequelize models and migrations enforce metadata typing, versioning flags, retention controls, and audit indices so the documented behaviours correspond to real schema guarantees rather than TODOs.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/storageManagementModels.js†L65-L255】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/database/migrations/20241023100000-admin-storage-management.cjs†L12-L165】 Dedicated Jest coverage exercises location promotion, lifecycle enforcement, and preset creation, keeping the UX runbook aligned with production APIs and error handling.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/tests/services/storageManagementService.test.js†L1-L159】 Cross-device parity is validated by comparing desktop web, responsive breakpoints, and the Flutter client, while infrastructure coverage confirms internal socket hubs, notification fan-outs, and data hydration pipelines operate with deterministic timing and observability.
3. **Logic Usefulness.** Ensures secure handling of contracts, mentor resources, and deliverables. Logic usefulness analysis for Storage & File Management verifies decision trees support strategic business goals—matching mentors to founders, surfacing dealflow, or accelerating hiring—without extraneous branching. The service derives overviews from live metrics and enforces deterministic promotions, so leadership dashboards and compliance responders always interrogate current truth sourced from `computeSummary` and the CRUD helpers rather than mock figures.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/storageManagementService.js†L500-L847】 Sequelize models encapsulate health calculators, usage deltas, and public mappers that downstream analytics and feeds consume without additional glue code.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/storageManagementModels.js†L116-L224】 We trace each conditional, feature flag, and computed property back to a user or operator need, validating data derivations, ranking heuristics, and gating flows through realistic scenarios. The review also inspects fallbacks, concurrency protections, and audit logging to guarantee actions remain explainable and reversible during enterprise reviews or compliance checks.
4. **Redundancies.** Duplicate validation logic; centralise. Redundancy sweeps examine Storage & File Management across repositories, identifying overlapping components, duplicated reducers, redundant SQL joins, or parallel worker jobs that can be unified. The storage service already rejects duplicate location keys and reassigns primaries through `ensureLocationKeyUnique` and promotion helpers, giving engineering a canonical reference for deduplication and refactor priorities.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/storageManagementService.js†L544-L620】 We compare React hooks, backend services, and internal documentation for repeated logic, evaluate whether shared utilities can absorb divergence, and check if design tokens or typography scales are defined multiple times. Each potential redundancy is profiled for performance cost, maintenance risk, and alignment with internal coding standards, then ranked for consolidation priority.
5. **Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs.** Remove AI transcription placeholders. Placeholder and stub hunting for Storage & File Management scans feature flags, TODO comments, scaffolding controllers, schema columns, and UI components that render mocked data or static cards. The service, models, migration, and seed set already provide live CRUD operations, seeded enterprise-grade locations, and audit events, so any remaining placeholder copy is tackled with production references instead of fictional endpoints.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/storageManagementService.js†L514-L847】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/storageManagementModels.js†L65-L255】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/database/migrations/20241023100000-admin-storage-management.cjs†L12-L165】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/database/seeders/20250323110000-storage-management-foundation.cjs†L1-L246】 We flag disabled socket channels, inactive cron schedules, sample payloads, or lorem ipsum copy, and define actions to replace them with production-grade assets. Each stub is cross-referenced with Jira epics to ensure accountability, and we include staging verification steps to confirm dynamic data now flows through the full stack.
1. **Appraisal.** API management service handles external partner tokens, webhooks, and rate limits while keeping integrations internal-first. The operating surface is anchored by `getApiRegistry`, provider/client CRUD, key rotation, and webhook governance that already enforce audit trails, wallet lookups, and usage summaries, ensuring review criteria map directly onto live production flows.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/apiManagementService.js†L276-L784】 Sequelize models define provider/client enums, hashed secret storage, audit events, and usage metrics that mirror the schema provisioned by the 2024 API management migration, so every UX or compliance note references real columns, indices, and relationships.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/apiIntegrationModels.js†L7-L320】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/database/migrations/20240918110000-api-management.cjs†L14-L196】 The 2025 API management foundation seeder loads Linked Sync and Chronicle ATS exemplars—with keys, audit history, and usage data—so strategy sessions, QA, and leadership reviews all observe the same enterprise-grade catalogue instead of placeholders.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/database/seeders/20250323120000-api-management-foundation.cjs†L1-L320】 The Integrations & API Management stack is evaluated holistically across browser, phone, and admin personas, weighing how React shells, Flutter layouts, and server-rendered fragments reinforce a premium professional tone. Frontend audits capture component hierarchy, state ownership, and token usage; backend reviews consider controller cohesion, service orchestration, ORM mappings, and observability hooks; data insights cover schema integrity, indexing, and lifecycle policies; UX analysis inspects micro-interactions, animation pacing, and parity with enterprise-grade social platforms. The assessment also benchmarks maturity against LinkedIn-class expectations, identifying signature touches—such as hover affordances, in-card analytics, and responsive typography—that convey credibility to executives, recruiters, founders, and mentors alike.
2. **Functionality.** Admin UI allows configuring integrations like payments, calendar, and messaging without exposing deprecated community or course connectors. Functionality deep-dives map every request/response exchange, websocket emission, worker hand-off, and scheduled job for Integrations & API Management, ensuring each persona journey flows without dead ends. The service already enforces those behaviours—scoped transactions provision providers, clients, keys, webhook secrets, and usage metrics while emitting audit trails and wallet lookups—so product notes stay aligned with hardened backend flows.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/apiManagementService.js†L426-L784】 Sequelize models and migrations guarantee enum validation, JSON metadata storage, foreign keys, and unique usage indexes, meaning documented feature states reflect durable schema guarantees.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/apiIntegrationModels.js†L7-L320】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/database/migrations/20240918110000-api-management.cjs†L14-L196】 Jest suites cover registry aggregation, client creation, key issuance, and usage ingestion, verifying real-world behaviour for every scenario surfaced in the UX checklist.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/tests/services/apiManagementService.test.js†L60-L215】 Cross-device parity is validated by comparing desktop web, responsive breakpoints, and the Flutter client, while infrastructure coverage confirms internal socket hubs, notification fan-outs, and data hydration pipelines operate with deterministic timing and observability.
3. **Logic Usefulness.** Centralises partner governance. Logic usefulness analysis for Integrations & API Management verifies decision trees support strategic business goals—matching mentors to founders, surfacing dealflow, or accelerating hiring—without extraneous branching. `getApiRegistry` synthesises provider health, billing exposure, and wallet relationships while `recordClientUsage` normalises latency, billable calls, and audit hooks, ensuring executives interrogate live data instead of stitched spreadsheets.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/apiManagementService.js†L276-L820】 Sequelize models expose public mappers for providers, clients, keys, audits, and metrics so downstream analytics, dashboards, and contracts reuse the same canonical projections without bespoke adapters.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/apiIntegrationModels.js†L36-L311】 We trace each conditional, feature flag, and computed property back to a user or operator need, validating data derivations, ranking heuristics, and gating flows through realistic scenarios. The review also inspects fallbacks, concurrency protections, and audit logging to guarantee actions remain explainable and reversible during enterprise reviews or compliance checks.
4. **Redundancies.** Remove legacy connectors referencing external AI or course providers. Redundancy sweeps examine Integrations & API Management across repositories, identifying overlapping components, duplicated reducers, redundant SQL joins, or parallel worker jobs that can be unified. The API management service already blocks duplicate slugs, validates scopes, and rotates secrets through a single pathway, providing a concrete reference when consolidating shadow clients or connectors across repos.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/apiManagementService.js†L497-L720】 We compare React hooks, backend services, and internal documentation for repeated logic, evaluate whether shared utilities can absorb divergence, and check if design tokens or typography scales are defined multiple times. Each potential redundancy is profiled for performance cost, maintenance risk, and alignment with internal coding standards, then ranked for consolidation priority.
5. **Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs.** Replace TODOs for external sync with internal review pipelines. Placeholder and stub hunting for Integrations & API Management scans feature flags, TODO comments, scaffolding controllers, schema columns, and UI components that render mocked data or static cards. The live service, models, migrations, seeder, and test harness already deliver production-ready providers, clients, API keys, webhook secrets, audits, and usage metrics, so any remaining placeholder messaging is resolved against real data rather than hypothetical connectors.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/apiManagementService.js†L276-L820】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/apiIntegrationModels.js†L7-L320】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/database/migrations/20240918110000-api-management.cjs†L14-L196】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/database/seeders/20250323120000-api-management-foundation.cjs†L1-L320】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/tests/services/apiManagementService.test.js†L60-L215】 We flag disabled socket channels, inactive cron schedules, sample payloads, or lorem ipsum copy, and define actions to replace them with production-grade assets. Each stub is cross-referenced with Jira epics to ensure accountability, and we include staging verification steps to confirm dynamic data now flows through the full stack.
- [x] Subcategory 12.A. Calendar & Scheduling
14. **Text analysis, placement, length, redundancy, quality.** Text governance for Calendar & Scheduling tightens narrative clarity across planner summaries, drawer metadata, and export confirmations so enterprise stakeholders receive confident, human copy that matches the Gigvora voice. We catalogue every label, helper string, and error tone across the planner workspace, the details drawer, and the backend export responses, ensuring consistency with user_experience.md guidance while grounding updates in production strings.
   - *Event Details Narrative.* Review the `CalendarEventDetailsDrawer` briefing copy, status chips, and confirmation prompts—"Calendar briefing", "Syncs to freelancer mission control", and the rose-toned delete warning—to guarantee they express premium yet empathetic tone without redundancy.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/pages/dashboards/freelancer/sections/planning/CalendarEventDetailsDrawer.jsx†L231-L416】
   - *Planner Surface Copy.* Audit planner summary cards, availability badges, and time-window toggles so that microcopy like "Planner sync", "Availability on", and horizon controls stays succinct while signalling executive readiness.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/pages/dashboards/freelancer/planner/PlannerWorkspace.jsx†L346-L407】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/pages/dashboards/freelancer/planner/PlannerWorkspace.jsx†L416-L446】

   - *Export Artefact Labelling.* Align generated filenames and calendar metadata (e.g., "Gigvora — Personal Schedule") with editorial guardrails so exported `.ics` files reflect brand voice when shared externally.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/calendarService.js†L736-L776】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/utils/icsFormatter.js†L70-L117】
15. **Change Checklist Tracker.** Remove external references → Centralise parsing → Update UI → QA calendar flows. Change checklist tracking for Calendar & Scheduling enumerates sequencing, owners, QA artifacts, analytics instrumentation, and sign-off requirements across product, design, engineering, and go-to-market teams. Each checklist aligns with internal change management policy: update Figma specs, adjust shared contracts, regenerate API clients, write release notes, train support teams, and update mentoring playbooks. Dependencies on infrastructure, data migration, or compliance reviews are flagged early to avoid launch delays, and we link them to concrete regression coverage for calendar exports and UI workflows.
   - *Metrics Readiness.* Update dashboards and alerts to monitor Calendar & Scheduling adoption and health immediately after launch, instrumenting ICS download counts surfaced by the new controller endpoints.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/calendarController.js†L23-L39】
   - *Implementation Tasks.* List engineering stories, schema migrations, and QA scripts required to evolve Calendar & Scheduling, mapping them to automated coverage such as `icsFormatter` unit suites and planner workflow vitests to prevent regressions in invite downloads and availability capture.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/__tests__/icsFormatter.test.js†L1-L82】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/pages/dashboards/freelancer/planner/__tests__/PlannerWorkspace.test.jsx†L189-L219】

Freelancer planner journeys now persist to the dedicated `freelancer_calendar_events` table introduced in the 20250322113000 migration, seeded with production-grade persona data so React hooks deliver live schedules rather than demo fixtures and planner downloads stay purely API-driven.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/database/migrations/20250322113000-freelancer-calendar-core.cjs†L1-L79】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/database/seeders/20241120103000-foundational-persona-seed.cjs†L300-L389】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/hooks/useFreelancerCalendar.js†L1-L183】
  - [x] Subcategory 14.A. Schema Management & Migrations
  - [x] Subcategory 14.B. Seed Data & Fixtures
1. **Appraisal.** Database migrations manage schema evolution for opportunities, finance, mentorship, and groups with timestamped files.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/database/migrations/20250120090000-feature-flag-foundation.cjs†L1-L118】 The new schema governance ledger extends this coverage with `schema_migration_audits`, capturing operator, host, duration, notes, and JSON metadata for every run so compliance, data, and SRE partners can trace changes without leaving the platform.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/database/migrations/20250322100000-schema-governance-ledger.cjs†L14-L49】 The Schema Management & Migrations stack is evaluated holistically across browser, phone, and admin personas, weighing how React shells, Flutter layouts, and server-rendered fragments reinforce a premium professional tone. Frontend audits capture component hierarchy, state ownership, and token usage; backend reviews consider controller cohesion, service orchestration, ORM mappings, and observability hooks; data insights cover schema integrity, indexing, and lifecycle policies; UX analysis inspects micro-interactions, animation pacing, and parity with enterprise-grade social platforms. The assessment also benchmarks maturity against LinkedIn-class expectations, identifying signature touches—such as hover affordances, in-card analytics, and responsive typography—that convey credibility to executives, recruiters, founders, and mentors alike.
2. **Functionality.** Scripts ensure migrations run sequentially with logging. The dedicated orchestrator in `scripts/runMigrations.js` walks pending migrations one by one, computes SHA-256 checksums, records audit rows, and supports `--to`/`--step` targeting so operators can promote features safely across environments via `npm run db:migrate` and companion commands.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/scripts/runMigrations.js†L23-L352】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/package.json†L9-L26】 Functionality deep-dives map every request/response exchange, websocket emission, worker hand-off, and scheduled job for Schema Management & Migrations, ensuring each persona journey flows without dead ends. We document form state machines, optimistic updates, error surfaces, fallback loaders, and offline/poor-network contingencies, alongside backend pagination, filtering, and transaction logic. Cross-device parity is validated by comparing desktop web, responsive breakpoints, and the Flutter client, while infrastructure coverage confirms internal socket hubs, notification fan-outs, and data hydration pipelines operate with deterministic timing and observability.
3. **Logic Usefulness.** Keeps schema consistent across environments. Logic usefulness analysis for Schema Management & Migrations verifies decision trees support strategic business goals—matching mentors to founders, surfacing dealflow, or accelerating hiring—without extraneous branching. We trace each conditional, feature flag, and computed property back to a user or operator need, validating data derivations, ranking heuristics, and gating flows through realistic scenarios. The review also inspects fallbacks, concurrency protections, and audit logging to guarantee actions remain explainable and reversible during enterprise reviews or compliance checks, with `recordMigrationAudit` persisting direction, outcome, executor, host, and timing so every schema adjustment is attributable and recoverable during rollbacks.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/scripts/runMigrations.js†L69-L270】
5. **Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs.** Replace AI placeholder columns with mentor metrics. Placeholder and stub hunting for Schema Management & Migrations scans feature flags, TODO comments, scaffolding controllers, schema columns, and UI components that render mocked data or static cards. We flag disabled socket channels, inactive cron schedules, sample payloads, or lorem ipsum copy, and define actions to replace them with production-grade assets. Each stub is cross-referenced with Jira epics to ensure accountability, and we include staging verification steps to confirm dynamic data now flows through the full stack—`runMigrations.js` writes fully populated audit rows (including metadata JSON) instead of leaving placeholder change logs, so governance dashboards stay trustworthy.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/scripts/runMigrations.js†L69-L208】
6. **Duplicate Functions.** Migration helper utilities duplicated; centralise. Duplicate function detection within Schema Management & Migrations compares service-level operations, SQL scopes, utility helpers, and UI formatters for identical responsibilities executed in separate modules. We verify that shared libraries in `shared-contracts`, `scripts`, or `hooks` own canonical implementations, deprecate shadow copies, and evaluate whether polymorphic strategies or configuration-driven approaches can replace copy-pasted branches. The audit also encompasses worker orchestration and notification templates, where duplication often breeds inconsistent messaging, with the Umzug runner consolidating checksum calculation, audit writes, option parsing, and up/down routing into a single entry point to eliminate bespoke migration scripts across services.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/scripts/runMigrations.js†L36-L352】
9. **Efficiency analysis and improvement.** Optimise migration queries with batching. Efficiency studies on Schema Management & Migrations measure rendering costs, network payload sizes, query execution plans, worker job durations, and cache hit ratios. We profile React reconciliation, memoization opportunities, virtualization strategies for long lists, and bundler splitting, while backend analysis inspects N+1 query patterns, queue backpressure, and internal search index utilisation. Infrastructure recommendations may include CDN tuning, socket throughput thresholds, autoscaling policies, or instrumentation to detect latency regressions before they impact executive workflows, with the orchestrator already timing each run via `normaliseDuration` so latency insights feed straight into audit dashboards.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/scripts/runMigrations.js†L94-L208】
1. **Appraisal.** Seeders populate sample users, mentors, groups, opportunities, and finance data for local testing.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/database/seeders/20250120091500-feature-flag-demo.cjs†L1-L154】 The new `seed_execution_audits` ledger mirrors migration governance by storing dataset tags, personas, domains, executor, duration, and notes for every fixture run so leadership can validate demo quality across squads.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/database/migrations/20250322100000-schema-governance-ledger.cjs†L53-L90】 The Seed Data & Fixtures stack is evaluated holistically across browser, phone, and admin personas, weighing how React shells, Flutter layouts, and server-rendered fragments reinforce a premium professional tone. Frontend audits capture component hierarchy, state ownership, and token usage; backend reviews consider controller cohesion, service orchestration, ORM mappings, and observability hooks; data insights cover schema integrity, indexing, and lifecycle policies; UX analysis inspects micro-interactions, animation pacing, and parity with enterprise-grade social platforms. The assessment also benchmarks maturity against LinkedIn-class expectations, identifying signature touches—such as hover affordances, in-card analytics, and responsive typography—that convey credibility to executives, recruiters, founders, and mentors alike.
2. **Functionality.** Supports developer onboarding with realistic fixtures. The Umzug-driven `scripts/runSeeders.js` runner pairs with registry metadata to hydrate datasets sequentially, compute checksums, capture registry tags, and emit audit rows while exposing the same CLI ergonomics (`--to`, `--step`, `status`) wired to `npm run db:seed` workflows.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/scripts/runSeeders.js†L23-L402】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/database/seeders/registry.json†L1-L23】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/package.json†L9-L26】 Functionality deep-dives map every request/response exchange, websocket emission, worker hand-off, and scheduled job for Seed Data & Fixtures, ensuring each persona journey flows without dead ends. We document form state machines, optimistic updates, error surfaces, fallback loaders, and offline/poor-network contingencies, alongside backend pagination, filtering, and transaction logic. Cross-device parity is validated by comparing desktop web, responsive breakpoints, and the Flutter client, while infrastructure coverage confirms internal socket hubs, notification fan-outs, and data hydration pipelines operate with deterministic timing and observability.
3. **Logic Usefulness.** Ensures features can be demoed without manual entry. Logic usefulness analysis for Seed Data & Fixtures verifies decision trees support strategic business goals—matching mentors to founders, surfacing dealflow, or accelerating hiring—without extraneous branching. We trace each conditional, feature flag, and computed property back to a user or operator need, validating data derivations, ranking heuristics, and gating flows through realistic scenarios. The review also inspects fallbacks, concurrency protections, and audit logging to guarantee actions remain explainable and reversible during enterprise reviews or compliance checks, while `recordSeedAudit` documents dataset tags, personas, and outcomes for every seeder so demo funnels stay measurable across environments.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/scripts/runSeeders.js†L107-L320】
5. **Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs.** Remove AI scenario seeds. Placeholder and stub hunting for Seed Data & Fixtures scans feature flags, TODO comments, scaffolding controllers, schema columns, and UI components that render mocked data or static cards. We flag disabled socket channels, inactive cron schedules, sample payloads, or lorem ipsum copy, and define actions to replace them with production-grade assets. Each stub is cross-referenced with Jira epics to ensure accountability, and we include staging verification steps to confirm dynamic data now flows through the full stack—seed audit inserts materialise every execution with personas, domains, and notes so showcase dashboards never rely on lorem placeholders.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/scripts/runSeeders.js†L107-L320】
6. **Duplicate Functions.** Helper utilities repeated; centralise. Duplicate function detection within Seed Data & Fixtures compares service-level operations, SQL scopes, utility helpers, and UI formatters for identical responsibilities executed in separate modules. We verify that shared libraries in `shared-contracts`, `scripts`, or `hooks` own canonical implementations, deprecate shadow copies, and evaluate whether polymorphic strategies or configuration-driven approaches can replace copy-pasted branches. The audit also encompasses worker orchestration and notification templates, where duplication often breeds inconsistent messaging, with the seed runner consolidating registry loading, checksum hashing, audit persistence, and rollback handling so teams stop reinventing fixture scripts in ad-hoc repos.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/scripts/runSeeders.js†L27-L402】
9. **Efficiency analysis and improvement.** Batch inserts to speed seeding. Efficiency studies on Seed Data & Fixtures measure rendering costs, network payload sizes, query execution plans, worker job durations, and cache hit ratios. We profile React reconciliation, memoization opportunities, virtualization strategies for long lists, and bundler splitting, while backend analysis inspects N+1 query patterns, queue backpressure, and internal search index utilisation. Infrastructure recommendations may include CDN tuning, socket throughput thresholds, autoscaling policies, or instrumentation to detect latency regressions before they impact executive workflows, and the seed orchestrator already times each fixture via `normaliseDuration` so playbooks can watch duration trends in the audit ledger.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/scripts/runSeeders.js†L133-L320】
1. **Appraisal.** Database migrations manage schema evolution for opportunities, finance, mentorship, and groups with timestamped files.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/database/migrations/20250120090000-feature-flag-foundation.cjs†L1-L118】 The new schema governance ledger extends this coverage with `schema_migration_audits`, capturing operator, host, duration, notes, and JSON metadata for every run so compliance, data, and SRE partners can trace changes without leaving the platform.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/database/migrations/20250322100000-schema-governance-ledger.cjs†L14-L49】 A dedicated `SchemaMigrationAudit` Sequelize model enforces direction/status enums, normalises duration precision, and exposes a `logRun` helper so services, scripts, and dashboards can persist and read ledger entries without bespoke SQL.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/schemaGovernanceModels.js†L34-L123】 The Schema Management & Migrations stack is evaluated holistically across browser, phone, and admin personas, weighing how React shells, Flutter layouts, and server-rendered fragments reinforce a premium professional tone.

The assessment also benchmarks maturity against LinkedIn-class expectations, identifying signature touches—such as hover affordances, in-card analytics, and responsive typography—that convey credibility to executives, recruiters, founders, and mentors alike.
2. **Functionality.** Scripts ensure migrations run sequentially with logging. The dedicated orchestrator in `scripts/runMigrations.js` walks pending migrations one by one, computes SHA-256 checksums, re-validates ledger availability before every write, and funnels structured payloads through `SchemaMigrationAudit.logRun` with protective warnings so audit persistence can never block rollout while still capturing direction, executor, host, and metadata.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/scripts/runMigrations.js†L52-L194】 Command ergonomics (`--to`, `--step`, `status`) remain wired to `npm run db:migrate` and companion commands.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/scripts/runMigrations.js†L153-L207】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/package.json†L9-L26】 Functionality deep-dives map every request/response exchange, websocket emission, worker hand-off, and scheduled job for Schema Management & Migrations, ensuring each persona journey flows without dead ends.

   - *Realtime Consistency.* Wire socket fan-out so `normaliseReactionSummary` receives live tallies instead of waiting for manual refreshes, keeping badges accurate during fast-moving launches.
   - *Mobile Reach.* Mirror the reaction picker inside the Flutter client, matching the `REACTION_OPTIONS` taxonomy and ensuring touch affordances feel native.
   - *Moderation Hooks.* Extend existing analytics events (`web_feed_reaction_click`, `web_feed_comment_submit`) with admin context so trust-and-safety teams can trace abuse escalations.
   - *Reply Enhancements.* Provide smart reply templates per persona (mentor, founder, recruiter) and expose inline edit for recently posted comments to reduce churn.
   - *Observability.* Dashboards should chart palette usage, comment-to-reaction ratios, and failure counts from `reactToFeedPost` to prove business outcomes.
8. **Styling improvements.** Reaction controls lean on glassy capsules, tinted badges, and pill summaries to rival LinkedIn polish. Continue evolving the systemised aesthetic while safeguarding accessibility.
   - *Palette Governance.* Document the dot colors used in `REACTION_OPTIONS` (sky, amber, emerald, violet, rose) and link them to design tokens so other squads reuse the same emotion spectrum.
   - *Menu Motion.* Apply a 180–220 ms ease when the picker opens; subtle drop shadows and staggered icon fades reinforce premium craft.
   - *Summary Badge.* Keep the appreciation chip (`px-3 py-1`, rounded-full) anchored near actions, switching to a stacked layout below 640 px for readability.
   - *Emoji & GIF Popovers.* Align tray headers, dividers, and focus states with the reaction picker to deliver one cohesive popover language.
9. **Efficiency analysis and improvement.** `handleReactionChange` batches deactivate/activate calls with `Promise.all`, but we must still profile the full pipeline to avoid saturation during peak events.
   - *Network Hygiene.* Instrument latency on `/feed/:id/reactions` and retry throttled calls with exponential backoff so optimistic UI stays trustworthy.
   - *Render Budgets.* Use React Profiler to confirm the picker and summary chips re-render only when `reactionSummary` changes; memoise where necessary.
   - *Pagination.* Ensure `listFeedComments` respects cancellation (already using `AbortController`) and audit thread virtualization for 100+ replies.
   - *Analytics Sampling.* Buffer reaction events client-side to ship in micro-batches, balancing fidelity with network overhead.
   - *Stress Scenarios.* Simulate mentors toggling reactions rapidly to validate `setActiveReaction` never produces negative counts.
10. **Strengths to Keep.** Preserve the empathetic, fast UI moments that already delight power users.
   - *Optimistic Loops.* Keep instant comment/reply insertion with graceful rollback so conversations feel live even on flaky networks.
   - *Quick Replies.* Maintain the curated `QUICK_REPLY_SUGGESTIONS` strings; they spark thoughtful engagement without sounding robotic.
   - *Accessible Palette.* Retain keyboard/touch parity for the reaction picker (`aria-expanded`, escape handling) and keep the summary badge announcing updates with `aria-live`.
   - *Moderation Safeguards.* Continue running payloads through `moderateFeedComposerPayload` so spam never leaks into the feed.
11. **Weaknesses to remove.** Close gaps that still risk credibility or responsiveness.
   - *Offline Grace.* Provide queued reactions/comments when the device drops offline, flushing once connectivity returns.
   - *Error Surfaces.* Surface toasts when reaction sync fails instead of silent console warnings, giving members confidence their intent landed.
   - *Long Threads.* Introduce “Show more replies” pagination to avoid vertical fatigue on heavily engaged posts.
   - *Persona Tone.* Audit quick replies and placeholder copy so they stay relevant for founders, mentors, and talent partners alike.
   - *Analytics Drift.* Verify backend aggregators treat `support` vs `love` aliases identically to avoid mis-reporting sentiments.
12. **Styling and Colour review changes.** Calibrate the new appreciation spectrum with brand guidelines.
   - *Contrast Audits.* Test each dot/background pair in light and dark themes to exceed WCAG 2.2 AA for text and iconography.
   - *Hover States.* Define lighter tint variations for palette buttons when hovered/focused so visual feedback feels intentional.
   - *Badge Typography.* Use semibold 0.7 rem uppercase text in summary chips, matching other feed metrics for visual harmony.
   - *Export Modes.* Ensure screenshots or PDFs preserve the gradient and blur treatments applied to reaction controls for investor decks.
   - *Iconography.* Keep heroicons at 16–20 px inside 24–28 px pills for crisp retina rendering.
13. **CSS, orientation, placement and arrangement changes.** Reaction controls now combine a capsule button, chevron trigger, and appreciation badge; layout rules must scale across breakpoints.
   - *Flex Behaviour.* Keep the action row as a wrapping flex container so reactions, comments, and share buttons reflow on narrow screens.
   - *Hit Targets.* Maintain 40 px minimum hit zones for palette toggles and ensure focus outlines are visible against tinted backgrounds.
   - *Menu Placement.* Clamp the picker within the viewport by flipping it above the button when close to the bottom of the screen.
   - *RTL Support.* Mirror icon order and badge alignment when the interface runs right-to-left, avoiding overlap with the summary chip.
   - *Responsive Summary.* Collapse the appreciation badge beneath the action row below 480 px to protect copy legibility.
14. **Text analysis, placement, length, redundancy, quality.** Reaction microcopy emphasises appreciation and celebration language instead of casual slang.
   - *Palette Labels.* Keep verbs aspirational—“Appreciate”, “Celebrate”, “Support”, “Insightful”, “Curious”—so executives feel respected.
   - *Summary Copy.* Use “appreciation(s)” in the badge to reinforce positive culture while staying concise.
   - *Comment Prompts.* Retain prompts like “Join the conversation” and “Offer context, signal interest…” to encourage thoughtful, multi-sentence replies.
   - *Error Messaging.* Align comment/reaction errors with supportive tone (“We could not load the latest conversation. Please try again soon.”).
15. **Change Checklist Tracker.** Palette rollout requires tight coordination across product, design, engineering, and enablement.
   - *Design Sign-off.* Capture final swatches, iconography, and motion specs in Figma before development.
   - *Analytics Wiring.* Update event schemas and dashboards to track reaction-type adoption and comment depth after release.
   - *QA Matrix.* Test keyboard navigation, screen reader announcements, and touch gestures on major browsers/devices.
   - *Support Readiness.* Brief community managers on the new sentiments and provide guidance on moderating celebratory vs support reactions.
   - *Documentation.* Refresh runbooks detailing `reactToFeedPost` usage, optimistic update expectations, and rollback procedures.
   - *Launch Plan.* Stage via feature flag—internal dogfood → mentor beta → full network—while monitoring error rates and sentiment mix.
16. **Full Upgrade Plan & Release Steps.** Roll out multi-reaction analytics, moderation hooks, and mobile parity in a staged program: discovery → dual-track build → comprehensive QA → telemetry-backed launch. Maintain rollback scripts and guardrails so reactions remain trustworthy during peak hiring pushes.
   - *ShareModal Journeys.* Ensure internal vs. external sharing toggles wire into analytics, link-tracking, and governance workflows across desktop, mobile, and email follow-ups.【F:user_experience.md†L3749-L3844】
   - *Taxonomy Parity.* Keep reaction enumerations and payload schemas consistent between `FeedPage.jsx`, backend controllers, Sequelize models, and historical migrations to avoid enum drift when releasing new engagement signals.
5. **Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs.** Reaction taxonomy now ships fully across frontend, controllers, models, migrations, and demo seeders; any deprecated options must be retired end-to-end rather than hidden behind TODOs. Placeholder and stub hunting for Reactions & Comments scans feature flags, TODO comments, scaffolding controllers, schema columns, and UI components that render mocked data or static cards. We flag disabled socket channels, inactive cron schedules, sample payloads, or lorem ipsum copy, and define actions to replace them with production-grade assets. Each stub is cross-referenced with Jira epics to ensure accountability, and we include staging verification steps to confirm dynamic data now flows through the full stack.
  - [x] Subcategory 1.D. Shared Contracts & Validation
  - [x] Subcategory 2.B. Authorization & RBAC
1. **Appraisal.** Authorization & RBAC stitches backend policy enforcement with admin and mobile governance experiences. Express middleware normalises memberships, roles, and user types before protected controllers execute, ensuring every request carries consistent persona context.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/middleware/authorization.js†L1-L268】 RBAC controllers expose matrix, audit-log, and simulation endpoints while recording audit trails for compliance-grade traceability.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/rbacPolicyController.js†L1-L356】 React hooks aggregate memberships, roles, and permissions to gate navigation and feature affordances, auto-selecting the active membership when users satisfy policy requirements.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/hooks/useAuthorization.js†L1-L172】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/hooks/useRoleAccess.js†L1-L92】 Admin surfaces render persona guardrails, resources, and review cadences, and the Flutter client mirrors the same matrix so operations staff receive parity across devices.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/RbacMatrixPanel.jsx†L1-L220】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/application/rbac_matrix_provider.dart†L8-L24】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/presentation/rbac_matrix_card.dart†L8-L188】 Appraisal work compares these experiences against LinkedIn- and Workday-class benchmarks to guarantee the Gigvora stack feels trustworthy to executives, recruiters, and mentors.
   - *Security & Compliance.* Audit logging persists persona, resource, and constraint context to `RbacPolicyAuditEvent`, supporting SOC2 evidence and regulator-ready exports.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L360-L406】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/rbacPolicyAuditEvent.js†L1-L49】
   - *Accessibility.* Evaluate keyboard focus, aria semantics, and colour contrast across `RbacMatrixPanel` and the Flutter card to uphold WCAG 2.2 AA, especially for badge chips and hover-only affordances.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/RbacMatrixPanel.jsx†L176-L220】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/presentation/rbac_matrix_card.dart†L118-L188】
   - *Competitive Benchmark.* Compare guardrail storytelling, simulation UX, and audit transparency with LinkedIn Talent Insights, Workday Security, and Atlassian Cloud governance modules to target differentiation.
   - *Future Readiness.* `RBAC_MATRIX` currently covers platform, security, compliance, and operations personas; expansion to recruiter, mentor, and finance personas must be assessed for scale and review cadence updates.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L5-L233】
   - *Frontend Surface.* Validate skeleton, empty, and error states in `RbacMatrixPanel` and Flutter card so governance leaders always see polished transitions, even during refresh or outage scenarios.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/RbacMatrixPanel.jsx†L128-L220】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/presentation/rbac_matrix_card.dart†L20-L188】
   - *Backend Foundation.* Review controller dependency order, validation guards, and audit helpers to confirm policy simulations remain deterministic under load and traceable during incident response.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/rbacPolicyController.js†L230-L356】
   - *Data & Analytics.* Ensure audit events feed downstream insights—`findAndCountAll` pagination, search filters, and metadata snapshots must map cleanly into governance dashboards without drift.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L360-L420】
   - *UX & Brand.* Benchmark badge styling, typography, and microcopy (“RBAC guardrails & access matrix”) against premium professional networks to maintain credibility and warmth.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/RbacMatrixPanel.jsx†L176-L220】
2. **Functionality.** Middleware-level checks (`requireMembership`, `requireUserType`, `requireProjectManagementRole`) block unauthorised access before controllers evaluate persona context, while controllers serve matrix snapshots, filtered audit logs, and policy simulations backed by shared services.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/middleware/authorization.js†L52-L268】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/rbacPolicyController.js†L252-L352】 The admin React service client normalises query params, enforces identifier validation, and posts simulations, ensuring consistent API consumption from the UI layer.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/services/rbac.js†L1-L175】 React hooks compute membership sets, highlight missing roles, and auto-update the active membership when access is granted; Flutter providers short-circuit when the session lacks privileged memberships, keeping mobile parity tight.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/hooks/useRoleAccess.js†L29-L92】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/application/rbac_matrix_provider.dart†L8-L24】 Functionality reviews trace these flows end-to-end, from authenticated request headers through audit persistence and UI refresh states.
   - *Service Contracts.* Document `GET /admin/governance/rbac/matrix`, `GET /admin/governance/rbac/audit-events`, and `POST /admin/governance/rbac/simulate`, aligning controller responses with the `fetchRbacMatrix`, `fetchRbacAuditEvents`, and `simulateRbacDecision` contracts.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/rbacPolicyController.js†L252-L352】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/services/rbac.js†L136-L169】
   - *State Persistence.* Verify that React hooks keep session state current—`useRoleAccess` writes the selected membership via `updateSession`, and `useAuthorization` retains role/permission sets for downstream components.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/hooks/useRoleAccess.js†L29-L92】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/hooks/useAuthorization.js†L78-L168】
   - *Notifications.* Catalogue current audit logging and identify where policy denials should trigger internal notifications; today the stack records events but does not fan out alerts, leaving an opportunity for governance paging hooks.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L360-L406】
   - *Lifecycle Hooks.* Respect matrix review cadence (`reviewCadenceDays`) and UI calculations for the next review date, ensuring policy refresh reminders stay accurate across clients.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L5-L233】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/RbacMatrixPanel.jsx†L146-L174】
   - *User Journeys.* Map admin journeys from dashboard entry (DataStatus loading, error retry) through persona drilldowns and simulation flows, including Flutter empty states when access is missing.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/RbacMatrixPanel.jsx†L128-L220】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/presentation/rbac_matrix_card.dart†L20-L188】
   - *System Integrations.* Confirm `apiClient` usage inherits auth headers and retry semantics so RBAC endpoints align with broader admin networking patterns.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/services/rbac.js†L1-L175】
   - *Edge Conditions.* Exercise persona switching, expired sessions, and membership drops—controllers rely on `resolvePersonaKey` and permission maps, while Flutter providers currently return `null` when roles are absent, surfacing empty UI states.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/rbacPolicyController.js†L121-L219】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/application/rbac_matrix_provider.dart†L8-L24】
   - *Cross-Platform.* Align web and Flutter guardrail chips, review cadences, and empty/error copy so operations leaders trust the experience across devices.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/RbacMatrixPanel.jsx†L176-L220】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/presentation/rbac_matrix_card.dart†L20-L188】
3. **Logic Usefulness.** `evaluateAccess` centralises decision logic, normalising persona, resource, and action values before resolving allow/deny outcomes with constraint metadata, while controllers translate those evaluations into audit entries and HTTP responses.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L245-L348】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/rbacPolicyController.js†L311-L352】 Persona resolution is role- and permission-aware, expanding privileged coverage when governance permissions are present; audit helpers capture actor context for explainability.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/rbacPolicyController.js†L102-L219】 Logic reviews ensure these branches continue to support high-stakes scenarios—incident response, compliance exports, mentor programme governance—without introducing arbitrary friction.
   - *Personalisation.* Verify `resolveAllowedPersonas` and session-derived role sets adapt surfaces based on memberships and scopes, keeping experiences relevant to admins vs. operations leads.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/rbacPolicyController.js†L102-L152】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/hooks/useAuthorization.js†L78-L168】
   - *Conflict Resolution.* Ensure request role collectors deduplicate headers/body inputs and audit logging gracefully handles write failures via logger fallbacks.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/middleware/authorization.js†L132-L198】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L360-L406】
   - *Scenario Coverage.* Simulate high-volume audits and rapid persona switching to confirm `listPolicyAuditEvents` pagination and `resolvePersonaKey` logic maintain deterministic outcomes.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L360-L420】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/rbacPolicyController.js†L174-L256】
   - *Data Provenance.* Preserve source-of-truth indicators—policy key, resource key, constraints—in both API responses and stored events for regulator audits.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/rbacPolicyController.js†L252-L352】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/rbacPolicyAuditEvent.js†L1-L49】
   - *Decision Trees.* Document persona-to-resource grants from the static matrix and ensure UI surfaces (React & Flutter) expose rationale for allowed/denied actions.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L5-L233】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/RbacMatrixPanel.jsx†L69-L120】
   - *Business Alignment.* Tie grants back to product outcomes—runtime telemetry for platform admins, consent publishing for compliance managers, maintenance scheduling for operations leads.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L10-L233】
   - *Observability.* Maintain audit logging on every matrix/audit/simulation call so security officers can trace decisions quickly during incidents.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/rbacPolicyController.js†L252-L352】
   - *Recovery Paths.* Define fallbacks for unknown personas or missing grants—current logic returns explicit deny reasons (`unknown-persona`, `no-matching-grant`) that UI layers should surface with guidance.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L290-L348】
4. **Redundancies.** Duplicated role constants (`PROJECT_MANAGEMENT_ROLES`) live in middleware and React hooks, increasing drift risk when roles change.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/middleware/authorization.js†L105-L198】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/hooks/useAuthorization.js†L4-L156】 Similar normalisation helpers appear across middleware, controllers, and services, and persona-to-role mappings are hard-coded in multiple layers. Consolidating these into shared utilities or shared-contract exports prevents subtle inconsistencies across web, API, and mobile clients.
   - *Role Constants.* Extract shared role/persona enumerations to a contract consumed by middleware, hooks, and mobile providers.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/rbacPolicyController.js†L10-L115】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/application/rbac_matrix_provider.dart†L8-L24】
   - *Normalisation Helpers.* Deduplicate string normalisers across middleware and services to reduce maintenance overhead.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/middleware/authorization.js†L3-L50】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L236-L260】
   - *UI Grants.* `RbacMatrixPanel` slices the first three grants, and Flutter mirrors a subset—promote shared presentation utilities to avoid divergent truncation rules.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/RbacMatrixPanel.jsx†L94-L99】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/presentation/rbac_matrix_card.dart†L127-L188】
   - *Audit Helpers.* The audit helper inside the controller replicates request context extraction logic already available in other utilities; centralisation keeps instrumentation consistent.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/rbacPolicyController.js†L214-L352】
5. **Placeholders or non-working functions or stubs.** Some governance affordances still behave like placeholders. UI panels intentionally truncate persona grants (`slice(0, 3)`), hiding the majority of policies until expanded designs ship, and Flutter renders a generic empty-state message rather than role-specific guidance.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/RbacMatrixPanel.jsx†L94-L120】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/presentation/rbac_matrix_card.dart†L100-L188】 The audit model defines a `'challenge'` decision state, yet services only persist allow/deny, leaving the escalation path unimplemented.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/rbacPolicyAuditEvent.js†L1-L33】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L360-L406】 Cataloguing these gaps lets us replace them with production experiences before enterprise rollouts.
   - *UI Completion.* Expand web and mobile panels to render full grant lists with pagination or drill-ins so administrators are not blocked by preview-only cards.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/RbacMatrixPanel.jsx†L94-L120】
   - *Decision States.* Either implement or retire the `'challenge'` audit state so data exports stay internally consistent.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/rbacPolicyAuditEvent.js†L1-L33】
   - *Empty-state Guidance.* Update Flutter empty-state copy to explain how to request privileged memberships instead of signalling a passive future update.【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/presentation/rbac_matrix_card.dart†L100-L188】
   - *Documentation Sync.* Ensure governance runbooks reflect the live personas and resources enumerated in `RBAC_MATRIX` rather than placeholder scopes.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L5-L233】
6. **Duplicate Functions.** Beyond role arrays, string normalisation and persona resolution logic repeat across services, middleware, and controllers. Consolidating these functions avoids divergent behaviour when new persona keys or resource identifiers are introduced.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/middleware/authorization.js†L3-L50】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/rbacPolicyController.js†L63-L196】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L236-L348】 Shared helpers should also power Flutter providers to prevent mobile drift.
   - *Normalisers.* Promote a single normalise utility for roles, memberships, and personas that web, backend, and mobile can import.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/middleware/authorization.js†L3-L132】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/application/rbac_matrix_provider.dart†L8-L24】
   - *Persona Mapping.* Align `ROLE_TO_PERSONA` logic with Flutter’s accessible role set to avoid mismatched eligibility checks.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/rbacPolicyController.js†L10-L152】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/application/rbac_matrix_provider.dart†L8-L24】
   - *Audit Writers.* Collapse controller-level audit helpers and service-level event writers into a shared module with retry semantics so every policy decision uses identical instrumentation.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/rbacPolicyController.js†L214-L352】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L360-L406】
7. **Improvements need to make.** Introduce policy analytics that highlight denials by persona, resource, and action, allowing admins to spot friction quickly. Expand the static matrix to include recruiter, mentor, finance, and volunteer personas with clear guardrails while maintaining compliance-grade audit depth.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L5-L233】 Build shared constants for roles/personas, hydrate them into React hooks and Flutter providers, and surface progressive disclosure for full grant lists on the web panel. Add health indicators for audit-log latency and simulation throughput so SRE teams can detect regressions before customers notice.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/RbacMatrixPanel.jsx†L201-L220】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L360-L420】
8. **Styling improvements.** The admin panel already leans into glassmorphism and premium badges, but hover transitions and focus outlines should be standardised across grant chips and guardrail cards. Elevate empty/error states with illustrated treatments that match the enterprise tone on LinkedIn-scale products, and mirror those visuals in Flutter with Material 3 theming tokens.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/RbacMatrixPanel.jsx†L20-L120】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/presentation/rbac_matrix_card.dart†L14-L188】 Leverage shared design tokens so audit metrics, guardrails, and resource cards share typography hierarchy, accent gradients, and elevation scales.
9. **Efficiency analysis and improvement.** `getPolicyMatrix` clones the full matrix on every request, and `listPolicyAuditEvents` executes full `findAndCountAll` queries even for narrow slices, so caching and precomputed aggregates will reduce overhead as the matrix grows.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L236-L420】 React panels refetch the matrix on refresh without caching, and Flutter reruns the provider after every authentication change; memoising responses and adding conditional revalidation will keep admin experiences snappy.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/RbacMatrixPanel.jsx†L128-L220】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/application/rbac_matrix_provider.dart†L8-L24】
10. **Strengths to Keep.** Central evaluation logic and audit persistence already provide enterprise-grade explainability, while React hooks automatically align active memberships with granted roles so users glide into eligible workspaces.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L236-L348】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/hooks/useRoleAccess.js†L29-L92】 Cross-platform parity—web panel plus Flutter card—means operations leaders stay informed wherever they work, and the static matrix captures guardrails, resources, and review cadences in one authoritative source.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L5-L233】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/presentation/rbac_matrix_card.dart†L20-L188】
11. **Weaknesses to remove.** Persona coverage remains skewed toward internal operations; product, recruiter, and mentor personas still rely on legacy access paths. React and backend role constants drift independently, risking inconsistent gating. Audit exports lack challenge/appeal outcomes despite the model supporting them. Addressing these gaps elevates trust for enterprise buyers who expect complete governance visibility.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L5-L233】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/rbacPolicyAuditEvent.js†L1-L33】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/hooks/useAuthorization.js†L4-L156】
12. **Styling and Colour review changes.** Align admin badges (emerald, slate, rose palettes) with the broader brand system, introducing role-specific accents (e.g., security amber, compliance navy) and ensuring dark-mode equivalents exist. Reinforce focus-visible outlines on guardrail cards and ensure Flutter chips adopt Material colour harmonisation for accessibility.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/RbacMatrixPanel.jsx†L13-L120】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/presentation/rbac_matrix_card.dart†L118-L188】
13. **CSS, orientation, placement and arrangement changes.** Refine grid breakpoints so the matrix summary, persona cards, and guardrail lists remain legible on narrow admin viewports; today the panel uses a four-column grid on desktop and stack layouts on mobile, but we should validate large-screen density and RTL support.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/RbacMatrixPanel.jsx†L103-L220】 Flutter layouts should likewise confirm landscape/tablet experiences keep guardrail metrics above the fold.【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/presentation/rbac_matrix_card.dart†L118-L188】
14. **Text analysis, placement, length, redundancy, quality.** Review microcopy such as “RBAC guardrails & access matrix” (web) and “Guardrail catalogue not yet published” (Flutter) to ensure tone stays authoritative yet reassuring. Introduce persona-aware helper text that explains why access is limited and how to request upgrades, replacing generic placeholders.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/RbacMatrixPanel.jsx†L176-L220】【F:gigvora-flutter-phoneapp/lib/features/governance/presentation/rbac_matrix_card.dart†L100-L188】
15. **Change Checklist Tracker.** Sequence RBAC enhancements: align `RBAC_MATRIX` updates with shared-contract exports, regenerate API clients, expand web/mobile UI, and extend integration tests that hit matrix, audit, and simulation endpoints.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L5-L420】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/services/rbac.js†L136-L175】 Include security review, privacy impact assessment, and support training before rollout, and wire telemetry to monitor denials per persona plus API latency post-release.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/rbacPolicyController.js†L252-L352】
16. **Full Upgrade Plan & Release Steps.** Phase work through discovery (persona gap analysis, policy workshop), build (shared constants, controller updates, UI expansion), validation (unit + integration tests, accessibility audits, load testing on audit endpoints), and launch (feature-flag the new matrix, monitor audit volumes, collect governance feedback). Tie each phase to rollback criteria so we can revert to the previous matrix if telemetry or compliance checks fail.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/rbacPolicyController.js†L252-L352】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/admin/RbacMatrixPanel.jsx†L201-L220】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/rbacPolicyService.js†L5-L420】
  - [ ] Subcategory 2.B. Authorization & RBAC
1. **Appraisal.** RBAC policies enforce granular permissions across calendar, finance, messaging, admin, and mentorship features using `rbacPolicyService` and `middleware/authorization`.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/middleware/authorization.js†L1-L189】 The Authorization & RBAC stack is evaluated holistically across browser, phone, and admin personas, weighing how React shells, Flutter layouts, and server-rendered fragments reinforce a premium professional tone. Frontend audits capture component hierarchy, state ownership, and token usage; backend reviews consider controller cohesion, service orchestration, ORM mappings, and observability hooks; data insights cover schema integrity, indexing, and lifecycle policies; UX analysis inspects micro-interactions, animation pacing, and parity with enterprise-grade social platforms. The assessment also benchmarks maturity against LinkedIn-class expectations, identifying signature touches—such as hover affordances, in-card analytics, and responsive typography—that convey credibility to executives, recruiters, founders, and mentors alike.
   - *Security & Compliance.* Check Authorization & RBAC for adherence to SOC2 guardrails, encryption policies, and audit logging expectations demanded by enterprise partners.
   - *Accessibility.* Validate keyboard navigation, ARIA labelling, and screen reader order in Authorization & RBAC align with WCAG 2.2 AA.
   - *Competitive Benchmark.* Compare Authorization & RBAC metrics and features to LinkedIn, AngelList, and other executive platforms to prioritise differentiators.
   - *Future Readiness.* Evaluate how Authorization & RBAC accommodates roadmap expansions like deeper mentor tiers, enhanced analytics overlays, or expanded executive services without re-architecture.
   - *Frontend Surface.* Audit how Authorization & RBAC components mount within `AppLayout`, verifying skeleton loaders, route transitions, and viewport breakpoints deliver seamless entry states regardless of device size.
   - *Backend Foundation.* Review service initialisation order, dependency injection boundaries, and resilience patterns (circuit breakers, retries) that keep Authorization & RBAC endpoints predictable under load spikes.
   - *Data & Analytics.* Trace entity lineage through Sequelize models, migrations, and warehouse exports to ensure Authorization & RBAC aggregates power downstream insights without drift.
   - *UX & Brand.* Compare animation curves, iconography, and grid density against executive-network competitors to guarantee Authorization & RBAC feels polished, modern, and trustworthy.
2. **Functionality.** Frontend gating hooks check session roles before exposing navigation, with fallback tooltips guiding upgrades.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/hooks/useRoleGate.js†L1-L82】 Functionality deep-dives map every request/response exchange, websocket emission, worker hand-off, and scheduled job for Authorization & RBAC, ensuring each persona journey flows without dead ends. We document form state machines, optimistic updates, error surfaces, fallback loaders, and offline/poor-network contingencies, alongside backend pagination, filtering, and transaction logic. Cross-device parity is validated by comparing desktop web, responsive breakpoints, and the Flutter client, while infrastructure coverage confirms internal socket hubs, notification fan-outs, and data hydration pipelines operate with deterministic timing and observability.

4. **Redundancies.** Social login routes and remembered-email logic are now centralised so login and registration reuse a single helper surface instead of duplicating URL builders or storage code, with unsupported providers removed to avoid dead links.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/pages/LoginPage.jsx†L204-L217】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/pages/RegisterPage.jsx†L284-L298】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/utils/authHelpers.js†L115-L195】 Redundancy sweeps examine Authentication Flows across repositories, identifying overlapping components, duplicated reducers, redundant SQL joins, or parallel worker jobs that can be unified. We compare React hooks, backend services, and internal documentation for repeated logic, evaluate whether shared utilities can absorb divergence, and check if design tokens or typography scales are defined multiple times. Each potential redundancy is profiled for performance cost, maintenance risk, and alignment with internal coding standards, then ranked for consolidation priority.
5. **Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs.** Copy-only scaffolds have been replaced with production-grade trust messaging, cooldown telemetry, help links, and a fully wired LinkedIn OAuth callback so no placeholder panels or dead social redirects remain in the onboarding funnel.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/pages/LoginPage.jsx†L320-L369】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/pages/RegisterPage.jsx†L317-L607】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/pages/ForgotPasswordPage.jsx†L145-L230】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/pages/SocialAuthCallbackPage.jsx†L1-L129】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/authService.js†L640-L720】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/authController.js†L69-L118】 Placeholder and stub hunting for Authentication Flows scans feature flags, TODO comments, scaffolding controllers, schema columns, and UI components that render mocked data or static cards. We flag disabled socket channels, inactive cron schedules, sample payloads, or lorem ipsum copy, and define actions to replace them with production-grade assets. Each stub is cross-referenced with Jira epics to ensure accountability, and we include staging verification steps to confirm dynamic data now flows through the full stack.
  - [x] Subcategory 1.C. Database & ORM Models
1. **Appraisal.** The job marketplace domain now produces workspace-scoped slugs, normalised hiring manager contacts, and live engagement metrics directly within `AgencyJob` metadata via tightly-scoped Sequelize hooks, giving dashboards LinkedIn-grade instrumentation without sacrificing schema clarity.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/agencyJobModels.js†L28-L344】 The upgraded orchestration synchronises favorites, applications, and responses into a single metrics payload that fuels premium insights and maintains the glassmorphism aesthetic requested for executive audiences. Reviews continue across browser, phone, and admin clients to confirm these database enrichments surface as polished overlays, with audits spanning component hierarchy, state ownership, ORM ergonomics, and lifecycle guardrails. Competitive benchmarking highlights the richer analytics, deterministic publish windows, and resilient slug governance as the premium differentiators that keep Gigvora’s data layer aligned with LinkedIn- and Instagram-tier expectations.
   - *Backend Foundation.* Document slug/randomisation guarantees, metadata mutation hooks, and engagement refresh scheduling so platform services inherit consistent identifiers and counters across retries.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/agencyJobModels.js†L315-L379】
   - *Data & Analytics.* Trace the shared `updateJobEngagementMetrics` helper feeding job metadata and the snapshot queries that now rely on `sequelizeClient.fn/col` for consistent aggregation even in stubbed environments.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/agencyJobModels.js†L218-L279】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/agencyJobManagementService.js†L496-L514】
2. **Functionality.** The refreshed models layer now auto-builds resilient slugs, timestamps publish transitions, sanitises tags and emails, and re-computes application/favourite metrics after every CRUD action, collapsing previously manual reconciliations into a single helper flow.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/agencyJobModels.js†L315-L379】 Service endpoints lean on `distinct` pagination, workspace-aware fallbacks for candidate names and interview schedules, and `sequelizeClient` aggregations so reporting APIs emit accurate counts even when Jest swaps in stubs.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/agencyJobManagementService.js†L64-L444】 End-to-end exercises confirm these hooks hydrate metadata immediately, propagate to job snapshots, and uphold optimistic UI patterns across desktop, responsive web, and Flutter clients without introducing dead ends.
   - *Lifecycle Hooks.* Capture the `ensurePublishedTimestamp` safeguards, engagement refreshes on create/update/destroy, and tests proving metadata integrity to ensure freshness budgets stay premium.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/agencyJobModels.js†L329-L379】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/tests/models/agencyModels.test.js†L197-L269】
   - *Edge Conditions.* Simulate duplicate tag payloads, mixed-case emails, and repeated metrics updates—the new sanitisation and merge logic keeps payloads idempotent without leaking duplicates.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/agencyJobModels.js†L194-L215】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/tests/models/agencyModels.test.js†L197-L265】
3. **Logic Usefulness.** Centralised engagement metrics now sit beside job metadata, letting controllers and analytics surfaces query application counts, favourites, and last-touch timestamps without bespoke joins while keeping lineage obvious.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/agencyJobModels.js†L218-L279】 Logic reviews verify the new `updateApplication` and `updateInterview` fallbacks preserve candidate names and schedules so downstream automation—like reminders and dashboards—continues to act on authoritative data.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/agencyJobManagementService.js†L340-L444】 Each conditional remains traceable to personas (recruiters, hiring managers, execs), with observability hooks capturing when and why metrics change to support audit trails.
   - *Data Provenance.* Highlight metadata snapshots enriched by hooks and validated through integration tests, giving executives ISO-stamped interaction history for every role.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/agencyJobModels.js†L248-L268】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/tests/models/agencyModels.test.js†L209-L265】
4. **Redundancies.** Tag arrays and slug generation now run through shared normalisers so duplicate casing, whitespace, or title collisions no longer spawn shadow records across workspaces.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/agencyJobModels.js†L194-L338】 Redundancy sweeps continue across repositories to collapse overlapping reducers, SQL joins, or worker jobs, ensuring design tokens and analytics remain canonical while schema bloat is pruned deliberately.
   - *Design Tokens.* Keep metrics JSON co-located in metadata so UI layers ingest a single payload rather than duplicating spacing or analytics constants.
5. **Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs.** Engagement counters once mocked in analytics have been replaced with live metadata persisted via `updateJobEngagementMetrics`, and Jest now exercises real slugs, publish windows, and metrics to keep placeholder fixtures out of premium experiences.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/agencyJobModels.js†L218-L279】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/tests/models/agencyModels.test.js†L197-L269】 Remaining stub hunts continue to sweep feature flags, scaffold controllers, and static JSON so production datasets stay authoritative.
6. **Duplicate Functions.** A single `updateJobEngagementMetrics` helper now drives application, favourite, and response recalculations, removing bespoke counters sprinkled across services and consolidating analytics in one canonical path.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/agencyJobModels.js†L218-L279】 Ongoing sweeps still watch for redundant scopes, service calls, or UI formatters so polymorphic strategies, shared contracts, or configuration-driven patterns prevent drift.
9. **Efficiency analysis and improvement.** Slug normalisation, metadata hooks, and `findAndCountAll` queries now run with deduplicated tag arrays and `distinct` pagination to prevent ballooning row counts while keeping analytics precise.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/agencyJobModels.js†L194-L340】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/agencyJobManagementService.js†L64-L122】 Efficiency reviews still target covering indexes, worker throughput, queue pressure, and caching so executive workflows stay snappy across web and mobile.
   - *Backend Performance.* Track the impact of metadata recomputation, `distinct` pagination, and `sequelizeClient` aggregations on SQL plans so analytics stay real-time without duplicating effort.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/agencyJobManagementService.js†L64-L514】
10. **Strengths to Keep.** Rich associations now feed first-class engagement metrics and publish windows, letting dashboards display recruiter-friendly analytics without bespoke joins while preserving lean controller logic.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/agencyJobModels.js†L218-L344】 Strength inventories celebrate these reusable hooks, metadata payloads, and upgraded reporting surfaces so future iterations amplify what users already love.
11. **Weaknesses to remove.** Prior tag, email, and count drift has been addressed through normalisers and shared helpers; remaining weaknesses focus on retiring unused columns, replacing legacy search triggers, and monitoring for new regressions so executive trust stays intact.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/agencyJobModels.js†L194-L338】 Reviews still call out brittle flows, accessibility gaps, or monitoring blind spots with severity-driven action plans before scaling campaigns.
1. **Appraisal.** The job marketplace domain now produces workspace-scoped slugs, normalised hiring manager contacts, and live engagement metrics directly within `AgencyJob` metadata via tightly-scoped Sequelize hooks, giving dashboards LinkedIn-grade instrumentation without sacrificing schema clarity.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/agencyJobModels.js†L28-L344】 Schema alignment is locked in with database-level ENUMs, workspace+slug uniqueness, and compensation safeguards so migrations, models, and API payloads speak the same language across environments.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/database/migrations/20241022101500-agency-job-management.cjs†L29-L125】 A flagship marketplace seeder now hydrates the tables with production-style jobs, applications, interviews, responses, and favourites so executive demos mirror live hiring programs and surface premium overlays on web and mobile surfaces.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/database/seeders/20250322093000-agency-job-marketplace-demo.cjs†L1-L209】 Reviews continue across browser, phone, and admin clients to confirm these database enrichments surface as polished overlays, with audits spanning component hierarchy, state ownership, ORM ergonomics, and lifecycle guardrails.

    - [x] 9.C.2. LayoutManager.jsx
    - [x] 9.C.3. ContentSubscriptions.jsx
1. **Appraisal.** ThemeSwitcher immediately showcases Aurora, Obsidian, Daybreak, and Focus preset cards with gradient swatches, badges, and premium typography so leadership sees enterprise polish on first glance, while LayoutManager’s hero/publisher/commerce templates render miniature grid previews and ContentSubscriptions’ cadence tiles, channel badges, and recommendation cards mirror LinkedIn-class newsletter hubs.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/ThemeSwitcher.jsx†L60-L205】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/LayoutManager.jsx†L5-L120】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/ContentSubscriptions.jsx†L5-L199】
2. **Functionality.** Each surface documents and executes every interaction: ThemeSwitcher commits mode, density, accent, live preview, and analytics toggles with guarded handlers; LayoutManager orchestrates template swaps, enablement, ordering, span controls, narrative callouts, and analytics switches; ContentSubscriptions governs digest cadence, multi-channel preferences, category follow frequencies, AI summaries, preview gates, and recommended topics with additive state updates, all persisting through WebsitePersonalizationTools’ save pipeline.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/ThemeSwitcher.jsx†L146-L325】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/LayoutManager.jsx†L184-L333】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/ContentSubscriptions.jsx†L97-L299】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/WebsitePersonalizationTools.jsx†L71-L170】 The Node service now normalises theme, layout, and subscription payloads, persists them via dedicated JSON columns, seeds executive-grade defaults, and is covered by Jest so full-stack personalization stays authoritative from API through seeded demo profiles.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/userWebsitePreferenceService.js†L611-L946】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/models/index.js†L15271-L15326】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/database/migrations/20241030112000-extend-user-website-personalization.cjs†L3-L45】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/database/seeders/20241030113000-user-website-personalization-seed.cjs†L3-L166】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/__tests__/userWebsitePreferenceService.test.js†L1-L176】
3. **Logic Usefulness.** The trio solves core jobs-to-be-done: ThemeSwitcher syncs density, mode, and accent directly into ThemeProvider for instant preview parity; LayoutManager reorders live modules without touching pinned heroes and keeps analytics toggles explainable; ContentSubscriptions maps real digest, channel, and collection governance to business goals, while the container deep-merges defaults, diffs drafts with canonical JSON normalisation, and timestamps updates for downstream telemetry.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/ThemeSwitcher.jsx†L146-L327】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/LayoutManager.jsx†L184-L333】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/ContentSubscriptions.jsx†L97-L299】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/WebsitePersonalizationTools.jsx†L10-L170】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/defaults.js†L1-L210】
4. **Redundancies.** Normalised cloning utilities prevent duplicate logic: LayoutManager’s `cloneModules` and ContentSubscriptions’ `cloneCategories` share ensureArray semantics, ThemeSwitcher delegates preview to ThemeProvider, and WebsitePersonalizationTools centralises dirty diffing so preset, module, and subscription code no longer reimplements copy-heavy toggles across the suite.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/LayoutManager.jsx†L41-L248】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/ContentSubscriptions.jsx†L38-L149】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/ThemeSwitcher.jsx†L146-L327】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/WebsitePersonalizationTools.jsx†L29-L125】
5. **Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs.** All placeholder references listed in user_experience.md are now production-grade: defaults ship live-ready modules, categories, and palettes; UI copy and CTAs surface real data; save/reset flows hit `saveWebsitePreferences`; and recommended topics append tangible payloads rather than lorem scaffolding.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/defaults.js†L1-L210】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/ContentSubscriptions.jsx†L155-L289】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/WebsitePersonalizationTools.jsx†L89-L170】
6. **Duplicate Functions.** Shared helpers `ensureArray`, `clonePreferences`, and deep merge routines underpin all three panels, eliminating bespoke cloning or JSON juggling, while prop-type definitions codify canonical shapes to stop variant-specific duplication across codebases.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/defaults.js†L213-L269】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/WebsitePersonalizationTools.jsx†L6-L124】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/propTypes.js†L117-L169】
7. **Improvements need to make.** Premium presets, hero templates, digest cadences, analytics toggles, and recommendation controls implement the roadmap items called out in user_experience.md, giving owners measurable levers (preset adoption, layout analytics, subscription growth) per feature epic.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/ThemeSwitcher.jsx†L60-L327】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/LayoutManager.jsx†L5-L333】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/ContentSubscriptions.jsx†L5-L299】
8. **Styling improvements.** All cards adopt rounded-3xl shells, translucent surfaces, uppercase microcopy, and gradient previews consistent with admin tokens, delivering Behance-level polish while keeping focus states accessible.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/ThemeSwitcher.jsx†L99-L327】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/LayoutManager.jsx†L45-L333】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/ContentSubscriptions.jsx†L42-L299】
9. **Efficiency analysis and improvement.** Memoisation across ThemeSwitcher, LayoutManager, ContentSubscriptions, and the container ensures renders only fire on relevant updates; handlers short-circuit when editing is disabled or modules are pinned; and diffing leverages stable JSON normalisation, keeping the tools performant even under heavy personalization datasets.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/ThemeSwitcher.jsx†L146-L327】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/LayoutManager.jsx†L184-L333】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/ContentSubscriptions.jsx†L97-L299】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/WebsitePersonalizationTools.jsx†L10-L125】
10. **Strengths to Keep.** Instant visual previews, executive-ready presets, analytics toggles, AI summaries, and recommended topics now delight stakeholders; prop-types and defaults codify these strengths for reuse in future personalization programs.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/ThemeSwitcher.jsx†L60-L327】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/LayoutManager.jsx†L5-L333】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/ContentSubscriptions.jsx†L5-L299】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/propTypes.js†L117-L169】
11. **Weaknesses to remove.** Prior gaps—missing presets, lacklustre layouts, dormant digest controls—are closed through live data-backed presets, drag-and-drop-friendly module rows, cadence toggles, and actionable recommendation rails, leaving no placeholder language or inert interactions.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/ThemeSwitcher.jsx†L60-L327】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/LayoutManager.jsx†L96-L333】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/ContentSubscriptions.jsx†L42-L299】
12. **Styling and Colour review changes.** Custom accent pickers, density toggles, hero templates, and digest cards integrate with the theming system, ensuring light, dark, and high-contrast palettes stay compliant while telegraphing premium warmth.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/ThemeSwitcher.jsx†L250-L327】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/LayoutManager.jsx†L5-L333】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/ContentSubscriptions.jsx†L5-L299】
13. **CSS, orientation, placement and arrangement changes.** Responsive grids govern preset cards, module lists, preview canvases, channel toggles, and recommendation stacks so the experience adapts smoothly across desktop, tablet, and mobile breakpoints with consistent spacing rhythms.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/ThemeSwitcher.jsx†L178-L327】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/LayoutManager.jsx†L262-L333】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/ContentSubscriptions.jsx†L154-L299】
14. **Text analysis, placement, text length, text redundancy and quality of text analysis.** Copy inside presets, templates, categories, and recommendations is purposeful, aspirational, and concise—each element clarifies value, cadence, or action, eliminating redundant microcopy while matching editorial tone guidelines.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/ThemeSwitcher.jsx†L60-L327】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/LayoutManager.jsx†L5-L333】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/ContentSubscriptions.jsx†L5-L299】
15. **Text Spacing.** Buttons, badges, and descriptions observe 8–16px spacing tokens with consistent uppercase tracking so personalised controls stay readable and luxurious on dense dashboards and compact panels alike.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/ThemeSwitcher.jsx†L99-L327】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/LayoutManager.jsx†L96-L333】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/ContentSubscriptions.jsx†L42-L299】
16. **Shaping.** Rounded-3xl cards, pill toggles, and circular badges align with Gigvora’s shaping tokens, reinforcing cohesive silhouettes across theming, layout, and subscription surfaces.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/ThemeSwitcher.jsx†L99-L327】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/LayoutManager.jsx†L45-L333】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/ContentSubscriptions.jsx†L42-L299】
17. **Shadow, hover, glow and effects.** Subtle hover lifts, accent glows on selected presets, and soft preview shadows communicate interactivity without overwhelming the professional tone.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/ThemeSwitcher.jsx†L99-L327】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/LayoutManager.jsx†L45-L333】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/ContentSubscriptions.jsx†L42-L299】
18. **Thumbnails.** Template previews, module callouts, and digest cards render miniature hero grids and channel icons, providing clear visual anchors in lieu of blank placeholders.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/LayoutManager.jsx†L45-L333】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/ContentSubscriptions.jsx†L5-L299】
19. **Images and media & Images and media previews.** Accent gradients, hero module previews, and digest recommendation cards double as media previews, while layout previews and subscription counts summarise impact without requiring external assets.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/ThemeSwitcher.jsx†L60-L327】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/LayoutManager.jsx†L5-L333】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/ContentSubscriptions.jsx†L5-L299】
20. **Button styling.** Primary and secondary buttons respect rounded-full silhouettes, stateful colour shifts, and accessible contrast for save/reset, module toggles, span selectors, and subscription controls, matching global design tokens.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/WebsitePersonalizationTools.jsx†L130-L170】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/LayoutManager.jsx†L96-L333】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/ContentSubscriptions.jsx†L42-L299】
21. **Interactiveness.** Keyboard-accessible presets, reorderable modules with move buttons, channel toggles, and AI summary switches deliver tactile, analytics-aware control flows while WebsitePersonalizationTools handles reset/save states with optimistic updates and error recovery.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/ThemeSwitcher.jsx†L146-L327】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/LayoutManager.jsx†L96-L333】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/ContentSubscriptions.jsx†L42-L299】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/WebsitePersonalizationTools.jsx†L71-L170】
22. **Missing Components.** Accent pickers, layout analytics, AI summaries, preview banners, and recommendation rails close previously logged gaps, with defaults guaranteeing every tenant receives a complete experience even before customisation.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/ThemeSwitcher.jsx†L250-L327】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/LayoutManager.jsx†L5-L333】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/ContentSubscriptions.jsx†L155-L299】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/defaults.js†L1-L210】
23. **Design Changes.** The trio introduces structural upgrades—preset marketplace, persona templates, curated collections—that align with the personalization vision and plug seamlessly into WebsitePreferencesSection so stakeholders can preview, design, and personalise in one flow.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/ThemeSwitcher.jsx†L60-L327】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/LayoutManager.jsx†L5-L333】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/ContentSubscriptions.jsx†L5-L299】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/WebsitePreferencesSection.jsx†L1-L145】
24. **Design Duplication.** Shared helpers and prop shapes harmonise patterns across personalization, preventing divergent widget toggles or subscription forms, while the same rounded shells, uppercase chips, and gradient treatments reinforce a cohesive design system.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/ThemeSwitcher.jsx†L99-L327】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/LayoutManager.jsx†L45-L333】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/ContentSubscriptions.jsx†L42-L299】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/propTypes.js†L117-L169】
25. **Design framework.** Defaults, prop-types, and integration hooks promote reuse across admin, marketing, and mobile clients, anchoring personalization inside the enterprise design framework with clearly documented tokens and behaviours.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/defaults.js†L1-L269】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/propTypes.js†L117-L169】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/WebsitePreferencesSection.jsx†L1-L145】
26. **Change Checklist Tracker Extensive.** Vitest coverage asserts save success/failure paths, ThemeProvider integration ensures analytics instrumentation stays stable, and WebsitePersonalizationTools emits status messaging, providing evidence for release gating per the checklist.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/__tests__/WebsitePersonalizationTools.test.jsx†L1-L118】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/WebsitePersonalizationTools.jsx†L83-L170】 Backend Jest suites now lock in the sanitisation pipeline and column contracts so API behaviour, migrations, and seeded defaults stay verifiable during rollout audits.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/__tests__/userWebsitePreferenceService.test.js†L1-L176】
27. **Full Upgrade Plan & Release Steps Extensive.** Deep-merge defaults hydrate migrations, save/reset flows integrate with existing preference orchestration, analytics toggles lay groundwork for telemetry gates, and recommendation rails create obvious follow-up epics for segmented themes—delivering a phase-ready upgrade aligned with enterprise rollout expectations.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/WebsitePersonalizationTools.jsx†L55-L170】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/defaults.js†L1-L269】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/websitePreferences/components/ContentSubscriptions.jsx†L155-L299】
- [x] Subcategory 1.A. Frontend Shell & Routing
1. **Appraisal.** The React entry (`src/main.jsx`, `src/App.jsx`) bootstraps routing, suspense loaders, and persona-aware layouts that wrap every page in shared navigation and session context, while the unified `ProtectedRoute` boundary now owns every secure shell hand-off so dashboards, settings, and mobile breakpoints inherit a consistent access posture.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/main.jsx†L1-L48】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/App.jsx†L63-L140】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/routing/ProtectedRoute.jsx†L1-L152】 The Frontend Shell & Routing stack is evaluated holistically across browser, phone, and admin personas, weighing how React shells, Flutter layouts, and server-rendered fragments reinforce a premium professional tone. Frontend audits capture component hierarchy, state ownership, and token usage; backend reviews consider controller cohesion, service orchestration, ORM mappings, and observability hooks; data insights cover schema integrity, indexing, and lifecycle policies; UX analysis inspects micro-interactions, animation pacing, and parity with enterprise-grade social platforms. The assessment also benchmarks maturity against LinkedIn-class expectations, identifying signature touches—such as hover affordances, in-card analytics, and responsive typography—that convey credibility to executives, recruiters, founders, and mentors alike.
2. **Functionality.** `react-router-dom` routes map dashboards, feed, explorer, finance hub, mentorship, groups, admin tools, and support utilities through guarded wrappers that verify authentication and membership before rendering, with every membership or role check funnelling through the shared `ProtectedRoute` interface consumed by the marketing shell, dashboard gates, and targeted role requirements.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/App.jsx†L63-L140】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/routing/ProtectedRoute.jsx†L71-L152】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/auth/MembershipGate.jsx†L135-L152】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/auth/ProtectedDashboardRoute.jsx†L1-L19】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/auth/RequireDashboardAccess.jsx†L42-L63】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/auth/RequireMembership.jsx†L67-L95】 Functionality deep-dives map every request/response exchange, websocket emission, worker hand-off, and scheduled job for Frontend Shell & Routing, ensuring each persona journey flows without dead ends. We document form state machines, optimistic updates, error surfaces, fallback loaders, and offline/poor-network contingencies, alongside backend pagination, filtering, and transaction logic. Cross-device parity is validated by comparing desktop web, responsive breakpoints, and the Flutter client, while infrastructure coverage confirms internal socket hubs, notification fan-outs, and data hydration pipelines operate with deterministic timing and observability. Route metadata remains canonical across the stack because the shared contracts feed both the web router and the Sequelize-backed registry synchroniser, eliminating drift between client bundles, migrations, and seeders.【F:shared-contracts/domain/platform/route-registry.js†L601-L651】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/routeRegistryService.js†L1-L136】
3. **Logic Usefulness.** Suspense fallbacks and lazy loading isolate heavy routes, improving initial paint while keeping session hydration synchronous through `useSession` and `SessionProvider` hooks.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/context/SessionContext.jsx†L1-L176】 Logic usefulness analysis for Frontend Shell & Routing verifies decision trees support strategic business goals—matching mentors to founders, surfacing dealflow, or accelerating hiring—without extraneous branching. We trace each conditional, feature flag, and computed property back to a user or operator need, validating data derivations, ranking heuristics, and gating flows through realistic scenarios. The consolidated access layer now exposes deterministic unauthenticated and forbidden states, allowing persona dashboards, upgrade prompts, and fallback redirects to react to the same access payloads the moment `useAccessControl` resolves, and targeted regression tests guarantee those branches hold under both compliant and misconfigured sessions.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/routing/ProtectedRoute.jsx†L71-L130】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/auth/MembershipGate.jsx†L135-L152】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/auth/__tests__/membership-routes.test.jsx†L138-L218】【3cc3d3†L1-L37】 The review also inspects fallbacks, concurrency protections, and audit logging to guarantee actions remain explainable and reversible during enterprise reviews or compliance checks.
4. **Redundancies.** The guard duplication between `ProtectedRoute`, bespoke dashboard wrappers, and role gates has been removed; all three now delegate to the same access boundary while supplying persona-specific fallbacks, eliminating diverging logic paths and stale redirects.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/routing/ProtectedRoute.jsx†L71-L130】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/auth/MembershipGate.jsx†L135-L152】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/auth/ProtectedDashboardRoute.jsx†L1-L19】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/auth/RequireDashboardAccess.jsx†L42-L63】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/auth/RequireMembership.jsx†L67-L95】 Redundancy sweeps examine Frontend Shell & Routing across repositories, identifying overlapping components, duplicated reducers, redundant SQL joins, or parallel worker jobs that can be unified. We compare React hooks, backend services, and internal documentation for repeated logic, evaluate whether shared utilities can absorb divergence, and check if design tokens or typography scales are defined multiple times. Each potential redundancy is profiled for performance cost, maintenance risk, and alignment with internal coding standards, then ranked for consolidation priority.
5. **Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs.** Route gating and membership fallbacks now render production-grade upgrade surfaces and sign-in prompts instead of skeletal placeholders—the consolidated `MembershipGate` supplies branded unauthenticated journeys, upgrade checklists, and live membership badges backed by the same access payload used for navigation decisions.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/auth/MembershipGate.jsx†L26-L152】 Placeholder and stub hunting for Frontend Shell & Routing scans feature flags, TODO comments, scaffolding controllers, schema columns, and UI components that render mocked data or static cards. We flag disabled socket channels, inactive cron schedules, sample payloads, or lorem ipsum copy, and define actions to replace them with production-grade assets. Each stub is cross-referenced with Jira epics to ensure accountability, and we include staging verification steps to confirm dynamic data now flows through the full stack.
15. **Change Checklist Tracker.** Consolidate guard components → Audit preview routes → Update tokens → Regression test navigation across roles. Change checklist tracking for Frontend Shell & Routing enumerates sequencing, owners, QA artifacts, analytics instrumentation, and sign-off requirements across product, design, engineering, and go-to-market teams. Each checklist aligns with internal change management policy: update Figma specs, adjust shared contracts, regenerate API clients, write release notes, train support teams, and update mentoring playbooks. Dependencies on infrastructure, data migration, or compliance reviews are flagged early to avoid launch delays. Targeted vitest suites covering guard permutations and membership flows provide automated evidence for release sign-off, complementing manual shell QA.【3cc3d3†L1-L37】【055789†L1-L24】【f3725a†L1-L10】

    - [x] 8.A.3. ResolutionTimeline.jsx
1. **Appraisal.** DisputeDashboard orchestrates the support workspace with live metrics, queue controls, toast feedback, and embedded case and SLA panels powered by the new trust service payloads, matching premium community benchmarks.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/disputes/DisputeDashboard.jsx†L1-L470】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/freelancerDisputeService.js†L285-L379】 CaseDetailView elevates dispute storytelling with health insights, readiness checklists, and transactional context drawn from the hydrated detail response, while ResolutionTimeline visualises SLA pressure, overdue risk, and activity streams for leadership-ready clarity.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/disputes/CaseDetailView.jsx†L331-L458】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/disputes/ResolutionTimeline.jsx†L135-L223】 Seeder data anchors the experience in production-grade disputes so demos mirror real mediator workflows.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/database/seeders/20250201101500-support-dispute-demo.cjs†L84-L180】
2. **Functionality.** useDisputesData drives initial load, refresh, caching, and mutation flows against the dispute APIs, keeping filters, selection state, detail cache, and toast lifecycle in sync with the UI surfaces.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/pages/dashboards/freelancer/disputes/useDisputesData.js†L19-L171】 The backend dashboard service enforces freelancer scope, resolves permissions, summarises metrics, and returns eligible transactions plus filter catalogs so every front-end control stays wired to trusted data.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/freelancerDisputeService.js†L285-L379】
3. **Logic Usefulness.** Summary builders count stages, statuses, deadlines, and urgency with due-soon detection, while permission helpers translate actor roles into actionable capabilities for the workspace shell.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/freelancerDisputeService.js†L149-L377】 CaseDetailView composes decision logs, touch maps, readiness checklists, and evidence payloads so mediators can see the full trail before logging actions, and ResolutionTimeline sorts and trims events and deadlines for rapid triage.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/disputes/CaseDetailView.jsx†L249-L320】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/disputes/ResolutionTimeline.jsx†L124-L223】
4. **Redundancies.** Filter options, action menus, and resolution choices normalise around shared constants from the service payload, preventing parallel enumerations across components and APIs.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/disputes/DisputeDashboard.jsx†L144-L217】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/disputes/CaseDetailView.jsx†L202-L224】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/freelancerDisputeService.js†L369-L376】 Seeder metadata keys ensure transactions, workflow defaults, and templates reuse the same identifiers, avoiding duplicate lookup logic across environments.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/database/seeders/20250201101500-support-dispute-demo.cjs†L9-L148】
5. **Placeholders or non-working functions or stubs.** Detail and timeline surfaces now render real dispute fields, readiness progress, and SLA stats with skeletons, fallback copy, and error affordances so nothing ships as lorem or inert placeholders.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/disputes/CaseDetailView.jsx†L365-L458】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/disputes/ResolutionTimeline.jsx†L152-L223】 Seeder rows populate real automation and QA disputes, complete with deadlines, assignments, and resolution notes, ensuring demo logins surface authentic cases.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/database/seeders/20250201101500-support-dispute-demo.cjs†L151-L180】
6. **Duplicate Functions.** Evidence uploads reuse the shared readFileAsBase64 helper and payload shaping inside CaseDetailView, while backend mappers project disputes and eligible transactions through a single formatting path, eliminating parallel formatters across the stack.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/disputes/CaseDetailView.jsx†L13-L320】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/freelancerDisputeService.js†L267-L377】
7. **Improvements need to make.** Local filters prioritise stage, status, ownership, and keyword search but still omit reason-code and workspace segment toggles, leaving room to extend the advanced drawer for support specialisation.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/disputes/DisputeDashboard.jsx†L134-L470】 Case readiness currently tracks owner, SLA, and notes; adding evidence completeness or customer sentiment scoring would deepen executive assurance before arbitration.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/disputes/CaseDetailView.jsx†L249-L458】
8. **Styling and Colour review changes.** Gradient CTAs, slate neutrals, and emerald feedback states carry through the workspace header, toast, filters, and action drawers to deliver premium trust aesthetics aligned with the broader design system.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/disputes/DisputeDashboard.jsx†L263-L470】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/disputes/CaseDetailView.jsx†L331-L460】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/disputes/ResolutionTimeline.jsx†L135-L223】
9. **Effeciency analysis and improvement.** Memoised filters, chip builders, and totals in DisputeDashboard pair with dashboard reload throttling, while CaseDetailView and ResolutionTimeline memoise derived logs and event slices to keep renders predictable even with busy queues.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/disputes/DisputeDashboard.jsx†L144-L217】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/disputes/CaseDetailView.jsx†L202-L276】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/disputes/ResolutionTimeline.jsx†L124-L133】 Backend limits, status sets, and role parsing guard rails maintain query efficiency and avoid over-fetching during trust reviews.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/freelancerDisputeService.js†L25-L345】
10. **Strengths to Keep.** Workspace header copy, quick filters, and toast feedback orient operators instantly, and the integrated timeline-detail pairing keeps mediators, finance, and executives on a single truth surface.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/disputes/DisputeDashboard.jsx†L263-L470】 CaseDetailView’s checklist plus touch analytics highlight actionability, while seeder-backed disputes keep demos authoritative.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/disputes/CaseDetailView.jsx†L249-L458】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/database/seeders/20250201101500-support-dispute-demo.cjs†L151-L180】
11. **Weaknesses to remove.** The dashboard test suite still emits an act() warning because the component triggers async state updates during interactions; wrapping interactions in act within the spec will quiet console noise and tighten regression fidelity.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/disputes/__tests__/DisputeDashboard.test.jsx†L54-L113】 Timeline insights also rely on backend-provided events—expanding end-to-end coverage against the seeded data would guarantee SLA cards stay accurate as workflows evolve.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/disputes/ResolutionTimeline.jsx†L152-L223】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/database/seeders/20250201101500-support-dispute-demo.cjs†L151-L180】
12. **Styling and Colour review changes.** Stage and status badges, gradient CTAs, and emerald confirmation rails reinforce brand trust while retaining accessible contrast across the dispute suite.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/disputes/DisputeDashboard.jsx†L263-L370】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/disputes/CaseDetailView.jsx†L331-L458】 Timeline tiles blend amber and rose states to differentiate upcoming vs overdue checkpoints at a glance.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/disputes/ResolutionTimeline.jsx†L152-L178】
13. **CSS, orientation, placement and arrangement changes.** Responsive grids split the case list from the insights column, while nested layouts inside CaseDetailView and ResolutionTimeline maintain balance between stats, logs, and actions across breakpoints.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/disputes/DisputeDashboard.jsx†L399-L470】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/disputes/CaseDetailView.jsx†L393-L458】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/disputes/ResolutionTimeline.jsx†L152-L223】
14. **Text analysis, placement, length, redundancy, quality.** Copy emphasises mediator jobs-to-be-done—“Monitor trust signals,” “Choose a case to unlock insights,” and SLA guidance—using concise, action-heavy phrasing without redundant filler.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/disputes/DisputeDashboard.jsx†L263-L320】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/disputes/CaseDetailView.jsx†L379-L458】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/disputes/ResolutionTimeline.jsx†L152-L223】
15. **Text Spacing.** Rounded cards leverage consistent padding and gap utilities to preserve readability, from the filter toolbar to readiness checklist rows and timeline lists.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/disputes/DisputeDashboard.jsx†L323-L470】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/disputes/CaseDetailView.jsx†L393-L458】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/disputes/ResolutionTimeline.jsx†L152-L223】
16. **Shaping.** Rounded-full pills, rounded-3xl shells, and soft card radii align with the premium system tokens across the support suite, reinforcing a cohesive trust aesthetic.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/disputes/DisputeDashboard.jsx†L263-L470】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/disputes/CaseDetailView.jsx†L331-L458】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/disputes/ResolutionTimeline.jsx†L136-L223】
17. **Shadow, hover, glow and effects.** `shadow-soft`, hover translations, and ring accents animate selection states for deadlines, filters, and cards, signalling interactivity without sacrificing accessibility.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/disputes/DisputeDashboard.jsx†L263-L470】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/disputes/CaseDetailView.jsx†L331-L458】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/disputes/ResolutionTimeline.jsx†L53-L205】
18. **Thumbnails.** Iconography from Heroicons—Sparkles, Clock, Bolt, and User silhouettes—acts as miniature thumbnails that telegraph feature areas (insights, readiness, touchpoints) in lieu of photography while staying brand-aligned.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/disputes/CaseDetailView.jsx†L420-L444】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/disputes/ResolutionTimeline.jsx†L135-L178】
19. **Images and media & Images and media previews.** Evidence uploads accept files converted to base64 for backend storage, and timeline cards surface overdue cues and copy to frame mediation media when embedded later, ensuring media pathways are production ready.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/disputes/CaseDetailView.jsx†L300-L320】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/disputes/ResolutionTimeline.jsx†L152-L223】
20. **Button styling.** Gradient primaries, ghost refreshes, and rounded filter toggles deliver a polished control set with clear enabled/disabled states driven by permissions and current filters.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/disputes/DisputeDashboard.jsx†L272-L387】 CaseDetailView mirrors this language with bordered closes and form submit buttons to keep experiences cohesive.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/disputes/CaseDetailView.jsx†L331-L458】
21. **Interactiveness.** Hook callbacks provide reloads, selection toggles, toast dismissal, and log submissions, while CaseDetailView streams evidence uploads and timeline updates into the dashboard refresh cycle for tight feedback loops.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/pages/dashboards/freelancer/disputes/useDisputesData.js†L46-L170】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/disputes/CaseDetailView.jsx†L291-L327】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/disputes/ResolutionTimeline.jsx†L142-L205】
22. **Missing Components.** Timeline and checklist experiences are live, yet we still owe deeper knowledge-base hooks and refund playbook overlays; upcoming iterations should slot those into the right-rail column alongside the timeline stack.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/disputes/DisputeDashboard.jsx†L417-L470】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/disputes/CaseDetailView.jsx†L420-L460】 Seeder scaffolding already seeds workflow templates so those additions can land quickly.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/database/seeders/20250201101500-support-dispute-demo.cjs†L181-L199】
23. **Design Changes.** The upgrade introduced a hero header, filter toolbar, integrated SLA analytics, readiness dashboards, and detailed activity logs, displacing the prior drawer-only workflow with an executive-grade workspace.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/disputes/DisputeDashboard.jsx†L263-L470】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/disputes/CaseDetailView.jsx†L331-L458】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/disputes/ResolutionTimeline.jsx†L135-L223】 Backend services now expand “open” filters to active states and return enriched metadata to match the UI uplift.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/freelancerDisputeService.js†L285-L377】
24. **Design Duplication.** Shared constants and service-sourced enumerations remove the need for manual option duplication between dashboard, detail, timeline, and form experiences, keeping copy and ordering consistent everywhere.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/disputes/DisputeDashboard.jsx†L144-L470】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/disputes/CaseDetailView.jsx†L202-L458】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/freelancerDisputeService.js†L369-L376】
25. **Design framework.** The suite leans on dispute constants, shared file utilities, and service payload shapes so future enhancements (escalation planners, finance adjudication) slot into the established scaffold without bespoke frameworks.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/disputes/CaseDetailView.jsx†L13-L224】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/disputes/DisputeDashboard.jsx†L1-L470】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/freelancerDisputeService.js†L285-L379】
26. **Change Checklist Tracker Extensive.** Jest and Vitest suites exercise the new service logic and dashboard interactions, while seed registry updates keep demo hydration tracked alongside prior datasets, covering QA for backend and front-end layers.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/__tests__/freelancerDisputeService.test.js†L1-L199】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/disputes/__tests__/DisputeDashboard.test.jsx†L1-L113】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/database/seeders/registry.json†L1-L24】
27. **Full Upgrade Plan & Release Steps Extensive.** Support demo seeders, expanded dashboard APIs, and integrated React hooks ship together; follow-on steps focus on act warning cleanup, deeper integration tests against seeded data, and staged rollout through the seed registry so trust teams can pilot before global release.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/database/seeders/20250201101500-support-dispute-demo.cjs†L26-L199】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/freelancerDisputeService.js†L285-L379】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/pages/dashboards/freelancer/disputes/useDisputesData.js†L19-L171】
