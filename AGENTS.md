   - Encourage product pods to retire legacy buttons and consume the suite’s canonical tokens and motion recipes.
   - Position the suite as the canonical button family within the design system, locking palettes, radii, spacing, and motion curves.
   - Track adoption through discovery, component rollout, design QA, engineering migration, and analytics verification milestones.
   - Stage releases through library publication, app-wide migrations, telemetry reviews, and iteration cadences informed by engagement data.
   - InputFieldSet.jsx now pairs glassmorphism panels, luminous focus rings, typographic rigor, and icon affordances for an executive-grade first impression.
   - Supports text, multiline, prefix/suffix copy, inline helper text, live validation states, masked counters, and accessory icons in a single configurable set.
   - Harmonizes with form hooks, ARIA descriptors, and contextual analytics so value changes, errors, and successes stay observable.
   - Retires bespoke input shells by centralizing label, description, prefix, and validation patterns inside the shared set.
   - Removes placeholders through production-ready helper text, focus states, and character counters that guide every scenario.
   - Channels validation, masking, and formatting helpers through a single pipeline to avoid re-creating logic per form.
   - Roadmap concentrates on advanced masking and OTP modules after shipping inline help, live counters, accessibility metadata, and theming hooks.
   - Glass surfaces, gradient focus halos, premium typography, and tokenized spacing align with the platform’s elevated styling system.
   - Forward refs, consolidated onChange handlers, and memo-friendly structure keep renders efficient across large form grids.
   - Preserve component variety—text, textarea, masked, icon-enhanced—so teams can compose rich form experiences without divergence.
   - Resolve prior blandness by standardizing spacing, surfacing clear error and success treatments, and delivering polished helper text zones.
   - Mirror global palette tokens with accessible success, warning, and error hues plus high-contrast focus outlines for every theme.
   - Lock label alignment, padding scales, and grid spacing so stacked and inline layouts feel balanced on any breakpoint.
   - Document label tone, helper text patterns, and microcopy do’s/don’ts for aspirational yet direct guidance.
   - Maintain 12px label-field spacing and responsive letter-spacing to keep content legible across dense or spacious layouts.
   - Apply a consistent 14px radius with subtle inner rounding to echo shell components while signaling focus zones.
   - Deliver soft focus glows, gradient outlines, and assertive error highlights that respect light, dark, and high-contrast contexts.
   - Offer icon, text, and badge slots for prefix/suffix content plus mask hints, ensuring affordances stay aligned and legible.
   - Publish documentation previews showing neutral, focused, success, error, and disabled states with analytics hooks.
   - Coordinate with ButtonSuite so inline actions and trailing controls inherit the same spacing, focus, and pressed treatments.
   - Reinforce keyboard focus loops, descriptive screen reader messaging, and validation summaries for accessible data entry.
   - Remaining backlog targets OTP entry, segmented PIN inputs, and advanced masks after delivering counters, icons, and success messaging.
   - Form kit documentation now highlights tokens, focus recipes, and validation patterns alongside adoption and telemetry notes.
   - Encourage product surfaces to retire bespoke inputs in favor of the suite’s canonical label, helper, and validation modules.
   - Position InputFieldSet as the foundation for form tokens, radii, shadows, and typography across product, marketing, and admin flows.
