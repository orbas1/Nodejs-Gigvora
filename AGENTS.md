  - [x] Subcategory 4.A. Internal Search & Discovery
1. **Appraisal.** Internal Search & Discovery now presents a production-ready stack anchored by `gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/controllers/searchController.js`, `gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/discoveryService.js`, and the persistent subscription pipeline introduced across `gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/searchSubscriptionService.js`, `gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/searchSubscriptionQueue.js`, and `gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/searchSubscriptionWorker.js`. Audits span the entire customer journey—from responsive React shells and Flutter companions to the Node.js orchestration layer—benchmarking parity with executive platforms like LinkedIn Recruiter. We inspect loading choreography, zero-state storytelling, skeletons, and guardrails around authentication and permission gating. Platform readiness reviews highlight telemetry via `gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/observability/searchMetrics.js`, resilience patterns in worker orchestration, and dependency health recorded by `gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/lifecycle/workerManager.js`. Each appraisal concludes with scorecards covering trust, clarity, speed, and brand fidelity so stakeholders can spot deltas instantly.
   - *Security & Compliance.* Verify SOC2-aligned logging in `src/utils/logger.js`, credential scoping in `src/utils/requestContext.js`, and permission enforcement for people search pathways.
   - *Accessibility.* Confirm keyboard support, ARIA semantics, and focus loops within discovery filters and result cards across responsive breakpoints.
   - *Competitive Benchmark.* Compare latency, ranking transparency, and personalisation depth to LinkedIn, AngelList, and Glassdoor to ensure differentiation.
   - *Future Readiness.* Validate that telemetry, migrations, and worker jobs scale to upcoming features like mentor tiers, agency analytics, or AI explainability without re-architecture.
   - *Frontend Surface.* Audit `gigvora-frontend-reactjs` discovery layouts for premium typography, hero framing, and contextual insights aligned with exec expectations.
   - *Backend Foundation.* Review boot sequence for search bootstrap (`src/services/searchIndexService.js`), ensuring circuit breakers, retries, and error envelopes maintain consistency.
   - *Data & Analytics.* Trace lineage from Sequelize models to new warehouse exports, confirming `SearchSubscription` and `SearchSubscriptionJob` metrics feed BI stacks.
   - *UX & Brand.* Benchmark motion, spacing, and iconography decisions against Gigvora’s brand system, capturing before/after mood boards for leadership.
2. **Functionality.** `src/services/searchIndexService.js` normalises opportunities, applies taxonomy filters, and returns ranked payloads with processing metadata; `src/controllers/searchController.js` orchestrates global search snapshots and enforces role-aware people search access. The queue-backed subscription flow persists payloads into the `search_subscription_jobs` table and executes digests through `src/services/searchSubscriptionWorker.js`, updating results, metrics, and schedule windows. Functionality reviews simulate each REST contract, worker tick, and migration path to ensure no stubs remain.
   - *Service Contracts.* Catalogue request/response envelopes, pagination semantics, and error codes for `/api/search`, `/api/opportunities`, and `/api/search/subscriptions` endpoints.
   - *State Persistence.* Validate filter, query, and subscription preferences persist between sessions via backend storage and secure cookies.
   - *Notifications.* Map manual digests, scheduled runs, and in-app alerts triggered after `recordSearchExecution` fires.
   - *Lifecycle Hooks.* Confirm worker bootstrap in `lifecycle/workerManager.js` honours runtime config, interval controls, and graceful shutdown semantics.
   - *User Journeys.* Document entry points spanning dashboard widgets, deep-link invites, and proactive mentor digests.
   - *System Integrations.* Enumerate dependencies on taxonomy services, analytics pipelines, and `SearchSubscriptionJob` queue workflows.
   - *Edge Conditions.* Exercise throttled networks, stale caches, revoked permissions, and network retries to verify graceful degradation.
   - *Cross-Platform.* Align Flutter discovery surfaces, mobile nav, and offline caching with web experiences.
3. **Logic Usefulness.** Opportunity ranking, remote detection, taxonomy scoring, and digest scheduling have been hardened into reusable utilities within `src/services/searchIndexService.js`, `src/services/searchSubscriptionService.js`, and `src/services/searchSubscriptionWorker.js`. Reviews ensure heuristics deliver measurable business value.
   - *Personalisation.* Audit weightings for taxonomy matches, geography, and seniority to ensure fairness across personas.
   - *Conflict Resolution.* Validate concurrency guards when deduplicating queued jobs (`enqueueSearchSubscriptionJob`) and updating subscription windows.
   - *Scenario Coverage.* Stress test high-volume founders, exec recruiters, and mentor cohorts to ensure search logic remains performant and relevant.
   - *Data Provenance.* Surface `meta` payloads that expose processing duration, filters, and index strategies for transparency.
   - *Decision Trees.* Inventory feature flags, eligibility checks, and gating flows controlling discovery experiments.
   - *Business Alignment.* Tie ranking and digest cadences to KPIs like candidate replies, mentor bookings, or opportunity conversions.
   - *Observability.* Ensure logs, metrics, and optional traces describe why each set of results surfaced.
   - *Recovery Paths.* Confirm fallback snapshots and safe defaults when indices rebuild or remote services degrade.
4. **Redundancies.** Legacy webhook placeholders and duplicate in-memory queues have been replaced by the database-backed `SearchSubscriptionJob` model and worker integration. Redundancy sweeps across services, React hooks, and schema design keep the stack lean.
   - *Dependency Graph.* Visualise shared utilities to avoid duplicate normalisers or filter builders.
   - *Documentation.* Merge search runbooks and operator guides into a single source of truth covering queue health, metrics, and rollbacks.
   - *Design Tokens.* Align discovery surface tokens with the enterprise design system to prevent parallel colour palettes.
   - *Analytics Events.* Standardise telemetry naming (`search_request`, `search_queue_enqueued`, `search_digest_processed`) for consistent dashboards.
   - *Code Review.* Consolidate duplicate filter transforms or query builders into shared modules.
   - *Schema Review.* Remove or migrate any deprecated columns now superseded by `SearchSubscriptionJob` tracking.
   - *UI Audit.* Decommission redundant cards or callouts, keeping the most insightful representation per persona.
   - *Process Review.* Assign single ownership across repos so the queue, worker, and controllers evolve cohesively.
5. **Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs.** All stubs around subscription queuing have been replaced with production code. The queue is persisted, worker retries implement exponential backoff, and migrations/seeders populate realistic records.
   - *Feature Flags.* Retire obsolete toggles; document remaining kill-switches in runtime config.
   - *Testing Coverage.* Expand Jest coverage to ensure sanitisation, queueing, and manual runs operate without mocks in integration suites.
   - *Content.* Replace lorem states with executive-ready copy for empty search results and digest confirmations.
   - *API Wiring.* Confirm manual digests and scheduled runs call the new queue functions rather than placeholders.
   - *Worker Jobs.* Ensure the worker auto-start path in `lifecycle/workerManager.js` is enabled in staging and production, with telemetry verifying heartbeats.
   - *Database Records.* Seeders such as `database/seeders/20250328104500-internal-search-digest-demo.cjs` load anonymised opportunities and digest jobs for demo tenants.
   - *Error Handling.* Exceptions now bubble through structured errors (`ApplicationError`, `ValidationError`) with logging and metrics.
   - *Fallback Views.* Validate snapshot responses when queries are blank so exec dashboards never surface empty panels.
