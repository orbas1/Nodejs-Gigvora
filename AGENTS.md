5. **Placeholders Or non-working functions or stubs.** Runtime maintenance orchestration stamps broadcast events through `markAnnouncementsBroadcast` while the worker updates `lastBroadcastAt` snapshots, eliminating TODOs and persisting audit-friendly history directly in the database.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/runtimeMaintenanceService.js†L207-L243】【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/runtimeMaintenanceWorker.js†L48-L81】 Placeholder and stub hunting for Backend Core & Server Boot scans feature flags, TODO comments, scaffolding controllers, schema columns, and UI components that render mocked data or static cards. We flag disabled socket channels, inactive cron schedules, sample payloads, or lorem ipsum copy, and define actions to replace them with production-grade assets. Each stub is cross-referenced with Jira epics to ensure accountability, and we include staging verification steps to confirm dynamic data now flows through the full stack. Seed fixtures mirror production cadence so operations dashboards and readiness probes stay hydrated, relying on curated maintenance announcements that cover active work, scheduled windows, and resolved incidents.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/database/seeders/20241101094500-runtime-maintenance-announcements-seed.cjs†L1-L78】
