1. Global Navigation & Shell
1.A. Header & Top Navigation ✅
   1. Consolidated the header structure into a three-zone layout with responsive flex behaviour so navigation, search, and actions breathe on large viewports while gracefully stacking on mobile. The gridless approach reduces horizontal crowding and keeps orientation consistent across breakpoints.
   2. Introduced a Headless UI-driven Insights flyout that combines navigation pulse metrics and trending destinations within an accessible popover, replacing always-on side rails to declutter the shell while surfacing the same intelligence on demand.
   3. Refined the marketing search experience with a centred pill control that expands under focus, supports keyboard submission, and resets gracefully after navigation, making global discovery more prominent without overwhelming the hero rail.
   4. Preserved authenticated role switching and primary navigation clusters alongside the logo, ensuring governance personas stay visible while the marketing mega menus remain within easy reach for unauthenticated visitors.
   5. Retained inbox previews, notifications, language selection, and creation shortcuts, aligning them inside a balanced action group with measured spacing so power workflows remain one click away without visual noise.
   6. Maintained analytics tracking for trending destinations through the insights flyout so navigation telemetry continues to register persona-aware engagement even after the UI consolidation.
   7. Applied translucent shell treatments, subtle gradients, and backdrop blur adjustments to reinforce a premium, LinkedIn-calibre aesthetic with restrained highlights rather than dense decorative blocks.
   8. Layered a mobile-first quick search dialog with curated trending deep links so small-screen users can instantly launch people, opportunity, and workspace discovery without diving into the mega menus.
   9. Instrumented global search submissions with persona-aware analytics and reset behaviour while echoing insights tracking inside the quick search drawer, ensuring navigation intelligence and query journeys stay observable across entry points.

1.D. Toasts & Feedback

   1. Recast the three-zone header scaffolding with balanced flex gutters and a softened gradient halo so navigation anchors, search intelligence, and action rails breathe from mobile through ultra-wide monitors without crowding the hero canvas.
   2. Embedded a SearchSpotlight surface beneath the desktop search pill that reveals live trending destinations and recent queries inside a floating glassmorphism panel, complete with hover-to-pin behaviour so users can read details without losing focus.
   3. Captured every successful marketing search locally, deduplicated the history to the latest ten entries, and exposed them as "Search “term” again" chips with a Clear control so power users can replay discoveries instantly while staying in flow.
   4. Added an inline ⌘K keyboard hint to the search pill and wired a global Ctrl/⌘+K listener that launches the quick search dialog, giving the header a command palette feel that mirrors modern productivity suites.
   5. Upgraded the QuickSearchDialog with mirrored history chips, trending rails, and persona-aware analytics so the modal serves as a universal launcher on desktop and mobile while keeping telemetry intact.
   6. Normalised marketing menu trends and search-configured highlights into one curated feed that hydrates both the Insights flyout and spotlight suggestions, ensuring the same premium destinations surface no matter the entry point.
   7. Recorded trending link engagement into the new history pipeline so clicking a featured surface instantly seeds the recent-search inventory and keeps recommendations contextually relevant.
   8. Hardened search submission handling with trimmed queries, history persistence, and graceful resets so the input returns to a ready state after every navigation without losing analytics fidelity.
   9. Tuned focus, blur, and hover choreography around the search spotlight to eliminate flicker, providing act()-safe transitions in tests and accessible escape handling when users dismiss the experience.
   10. Maintained the inbox preview, notifications, language selector, and creation shortcuts in a slim action bar, spacing each control to align with the new search footprint while preserving single-click access for frequent workflows.
   11. Preserved the insights popover with updated styling tokens so persona pulse metrics and trending callouts inherit the refreshed translucency treatments introduced for the spotlight.
   12. Synced the mobile navigation drawer with the new search services, delivering identical trending intelligence and analytics wiring on small screens so the quick-launch experience feels identical to desktop.
