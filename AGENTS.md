   - *Ops Telemetry.* Worker manager telemetry feeds runtime observability, broadcasting queue depth, stuck lock detection, and failure tallies for each orchestrator loop.
   - *Realtime Telemetry.* `getRuntimeOperationalSnapshot` now emits a `realtime` block derived from the socket server connection registry, mapping namespaces, user/socket counts, and anomaly signals when limits are breached.
   - *Worker Health Streams.* Operational snapshots aggregate `collectWorkerTelemetry` output into a `workers` summary that highlights queue depth, stuck jobs, and failure counts for every orchestrator.
