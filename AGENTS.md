14. **Text analysis, placement, length, redundancy, quality.** Microcopy across Storage & File Management must calm security anxieties while keeping teams productive. Prioritise verb-first language that reassures users their contracts, pitch decks, and mentor assets remain encrypted and versioned. Keep helper text under 90 characters so panels feel airy on desktop and mobile, and reserve technical jargon for tooltips or expandable accordions. Every state—idle, uploading, error, resolved—requires concise messaging that signals next steps without repeating surrounding labels.
   - *Primary Actions.* Label the main CTA with outcome-driven copy such as “Securely upload files” instead of generic “Submit,” and mirror the same phrasing across modals, drawers, and confirmation banners to build muscle memory.
   - *Progress & Status.* Pair percentage indicators with short descriptors (“Scanning for viruses…”) that confirm behind-the-scenes safeguards; ensure progressive states never exceed two short sentences.
   - *Error Handling.* Provide empathetic, blame-free errors (“The network dropped—your file is safe. Retry now.”) and include inline remediation links rather than redirecting to docs.
   - *Empty & Success States.* Replace lorem ipsum with contextual prompts tied to executive workflows (“Drop investor updates or mentor recordings to keep your team aligned.”) and celebrate completion with a single celebratory sentence plus a CTA to view the new asset.
   - *Localization Readiness.* Maintain a glossary of approved terms for “upload,” “vault,” “version,” and “retention” so translations stay consistent across web, mobile, and admin consoles.
   - *Metadata Labels.* Use crisp headers (“Owner,” “Retention policy,” “Last reviewed”) that align with analytics dashboards, avoiding duplicate descriptors or redundant tooltips.
14. **Text analysis, placement, length, redundancy, quality.** Copy within Integrations & API Management must explain value, compliance posture, and activation effort at a glance. Lead with benefits for founders and talent leads (“Sync ATS applicants automatically”) before mentioning technical steps. Keep integration summaries within 110 characters to preserve grid alignment, and standardise tone across cards, detail drawers, and webhook logs so the experience feels curated and enterprise-ready.
   - *Integration Cards.* Craft two-line descriptions: first line articulates the business outcome, second line highlights trust or automation signals (“GDPR-compliant, auto-retries failures”). Avoid repeating the integration name.
   - *Status & Health.* Use consistent badge text (“Active,” “Attention needed,” “Paused”) paired with subtext that states the exact remediation action in ≤60 characters.
   - *Configuration Steps.* Present instructions as short imperative sentences (“Paste the API key from Workspace Admin > Tokens.”) and reference in-product navigation breadcrumbs for clarity.
   - *Error Messaging.* Keep webhook/log errors factual yet calm, citing timestamp, request ID, and suggested fix without exposing sensitive payload data.
   - *Legal & Compliance Notes.* Surface regulatory copy in expandable sections labelled “Compliance” to keep primary views uncluttered while ensuring auditors can access required statements.
   - *Multi-channel Consistency.* Synchronise copy between marketing site, admin console, and in-app tooltips so partners receive the same messaging regardless of touchpoint.
