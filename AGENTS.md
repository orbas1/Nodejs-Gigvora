2. **Functionality.** UI presents secure download flows, signature tracking, and policy management. Functionality deep-dives map every request/response exchange, websocket emission, worker hand-off, and scheduled job for Compliance Locker & Legal Policies, ensuring each persona journey flows without dead ends. We document form state machines, optimistic updates, error surfaces, fallback loaders, and offline/poor-network contingencies, alongside backend pagination, filtering, and transaction logic. Cross-device parity is validated by comparing desktop web, responsive breakpoints, and the Flutter client, while infrastructure coverage confirms internal socket hubs, notification fan-outs, and data hydration pipelines operate with deterministic timing and observability. Recent backend work now injects legal policy acknowledgements and publication metadata into the locker payload so downstream surfaces consume a single, canonical response, while the React shell renders acknowledgement chips and legal-library cards with contextual actions for founders, auditors, and partners.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/complianceLockerService.js†L709-L945】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/compliance/ContractComplianceLocker.jsx†L507-L617】
3. **Logic Usefulness.** Centralises governance for auditors. Logic usefulness analysis for Compliance Locker & Legal Policies verifies decision trees support strategic business goals—matching mentors to founders, surfacing dealflow, or accelerating hiring—without extraneous branching. We trace each conditional, feature flag, and computed property back to a user or operator need, validating data derivations, ranking heuristics, and gating flows through realistic scenarios. The review also inspects fallbacks, concurrency protections, and audit logging to guarantee actions remain explainable and reversible during enterprise reviews or compliance checks. Current logic flags outstanding policy acknowledgements, expired legal publications, and stale consent versions inside the aggregated payload so teams can prioritise remediation directly from the locker dashboard.【F:gigvora-backend-nodejs/src/services/complianceLockerService.js†L763-L945】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/compliance/ContractComplianceLocker.jsx†L253-L399】
8. **Styling improvements.** Use premium typography and iconography for trust-building. Styling improvements for Compliance Locker & Legal Policies explore component-level polish: high-density grids vs. spacious cards, responsive reflow, iconography alignment, and motion design tuned to signal professionalism. We reference Gigvora's design tokens, brand gradients, and type scale, recommending consistent use of neutrals, electric blues, and accent violets to mirror LinkedIn-level trust. Reviews also cover dark-mode readiness, accessible contrast ratios, focus states, and background blur or glassmorphism treatments that elevate interactive surfaces without sacrificing clarity. The refreshed React locker ships policy acknowledgement badges and legal-library cards with premium typography, gradient chips, and responsive grids so legal content feels as elevated as client-facing storytelling.【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/compliance/ContractComplianceLocker.jsx†L253-L399】【F:gigvora-frontend-reactjs/src/components/compliance/ContractComplianceLocker.jsx†L507-L617】
