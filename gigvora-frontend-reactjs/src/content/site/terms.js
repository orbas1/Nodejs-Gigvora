  body: `## 1. About these terms
Gigvora Technologies Ltd of 38 Chancery Lane, London WC2A 1EN (“Gigvora”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) operates an online platform that enables companies, agencies, independent professionals, mentors, headhunters, students, and community partners (together “Members”) to discover, contract, and collaborate on projects, gigs, volunteering assignments, and Experience Launchpad programmes. These Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) form a legally binding agreement between Gigvora and every individual or organisation that uses our web platform, APIs, collaboration tools, finance features, and support channels. The Terms incorporate by reference any specific policies, guidelines, and product-specific conditions referenced in dashboards, onboarding flows, invoices, or order forms that we issue to you. If a conflict arises, the hierarchy of documents is: (a) enterprise agreement or statement of work; (b) tailored product schedules; (c) these Terms; and (d) support articles or FAQs. By creating an account, accepting an invitation to a workspace, signing an order form, or otherwise accessing the platform you confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to comply with these Terms on behalf of yourself or the business entity that you represent.
These Terms are governed by the laws of England and Wales. Consumers located in the United Kingdom retain their statutory rights under the Consumer Rights Act 2015 and other mandatory legislation. Nothing in these Terms reduces those protections. We strongly recommend that businesses obtain independent legal advice before launching programmes, publishing briefs, or commissioning work through the platform. The English language version of these Terms prevails over any translation provided for convenience. If you do not agree to the Terms you must not use the platform. Continuing to access the services after an update is published constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.

## 2. Definitions
Unless the context requires otherwise, the following definitions apply: “Agreement” means these Terms together with any applicable schedules, order forms, and policies. “Business Day” means Monday to Friday excluding English bank holidays. “Client” means any company, public body, charity, or agency using the platform to source talent or services. “Talent” means an individual freelancer, consultant, mentor, volunteer, or small business acting as an independent contractor. “Workspace” means a secure environment within the platform configured for a Client or programme. “Launchpad” means Gigvora’s structured programme for training and matching early-career talent. “Escrow” means the segregated client money account administered by our FCA-regulated payment partners. “Content” means data, briefs, deliverables, reviews, profiles, documents, media, and messages uploaded or generated through the services. “Policies” means supplementary rules covering community conduct, privacy, data processing, cookies, refunds, and security. Words in the singular include the plural and vice versa. References to statutes include amendments and re-enactments. Headings are for convenience only and do not affect interpretation.
We provide glossary tooltips throughout the platform to aid comprehension. If there is ambiguity, the definitions in this clause prevail. Where an enterprise contract uses alternative terminology, its definitions supersede these, provided they are expressly stated in writing and signed by both parties. For clarity, Gigvora operates as a marketplace facilitator; we do not employ Talent, act as an employment agency within the meaning of the Employment Agencies Act 1973, nor guarantee engagements unless expressly agreed in writing.

## 3. Account eligibility and onboarding
You must be at least 18 years old to create an account. Companies, agencies, universities, and public sector bodies must ensure that the individual completing onboarding has authority to bind the organisation. We reserve the right to request documentary evidence including company incorporation certificates, VAT registration, identity documents, proof of address, and beneficial ownership information. Certain workspaces may require enhanced due diligence, such as DBS checks or right-to-work confirmation, before access is granted. You must provide accurate, complete, and up-to-date information during onboarding and keep it updated throughout your membership. Gigvora may reject, suspend, or terminate accounts where information is false, misleading, incomplete, or where regulatory obligations cannot be satisfied.
Passwords, passkeys, multi-factor credentials, API keys, and session tokens must be kept confidential. You are responsible for all activity undertaken through your account. If you suspect unauthorised access, you must reset credentials immediately and notify us at security@gigvora.com. Administrators are responsible for configuring role-based permissions, approval chains, data retention preferences, and single sign-on integrations available within the workspace. Gigvora is not liable for access granted in error by your internal administrators. We may impose limits on the number of users, integrations, or workspaces associated with your account according to your subscription tier or commercial agreement.

## 4. Scope of licence and acceptable use
Subject to your ongoing compliance with the Agreement, Gigvora grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable licence to access and use the platform for legitimate professional purposes. You agree not to (a) copy, modify, translate, reverse engineer, disassemble, or create derivative works of the platform; (b) resell, lease, or provide the services to third parties outside your authorised workspace; (c) circumvent technical protections, attempt to access systems without permission, or probe infrastructure for vulnerabilities except through our coordinated disclosure programme; (d) upload malware, spyware, or code intended to disrupt operations; (e) use the platform to send unsolicited marketing communications without valid consent; (f) harvest personal data beyond what is necessary for agreed engagements; (g) misrepresent identity, credentials, or the nature of opportunities; or (h) engage in any conduct that could bring Gigvora, our partners, or our community into disrepute.
We monitor for abuse using automated and manual processes. Where we reasonably suspect that an account is compromised or breaching these Terms, we may suspend access, quarantine content, require additional verification, or notify relevant authorities. You remain responsible for fees incurred during suspension unless the issue arose due to Gigvora’s breach. Failure to comply with acceptable use obligations may result in termination of this Agreement, forfeiture of escrow funds, and potential legal action. We may update acceptable use rules periodically to reflect evolving threats or regulatory requirements. The latest version is always available within the Trust Centre.

## 5. Platform services
The platform provides discovery tools, AI-assisted matching, messaging, document storage, project management boards, time tracking, expense capture, compliance workflows, financial dashboards, dispute resolution tooling, analytics, and integrations with selected third parties. Specific modules available to you depend on your subscription plan, geographic location, and any bespoke configuration documented in an order form. We continuously improve the services and may add, modify, or retire features. Material changes that reduce core functionality will be communicated at least 30 days in advance unless security, legal, or compliance reasons require immediate action. Beta or experimental features may be offered without warranty, may collect additional telemetry, and can be withdrawn at any time. By enabling a beta feature you acknowledge these limitations and agree to provide feedback where reasonably requested.
We endeavour to maintain platform availability of at least 99.5% uptime each calendar month excluding scheduled maintenance, force majeure events, or disruptions caused by customer-controlled systems. Planned maintenance windows are published in the Trust Centre status page. If we fail to meet uptime commitments and you hold an enterprise service level agreement, you may request service credits as the exclusive remedy. Credits must be claimed within 30 days of the incident and applied against future invoices. We are not responsible for outages caused by internet service providers, cloud hosting providers, payment partners, or other third parties outside our reasonable control.

## 6. Community conduct and content standards
Members must interact respectfully and professionally. You agree to follow our Community Guidelines, Anti-Harassment Policy, Diversity and Inclusion commitments, and Moderation Rules. Prohibited content includes hate speech, unlawful discrimination, defamation, explicit material unrelated to professional engagements, threats, or encouragement of illegal activity. You must not post confidential information about third parties without permission. Reviews and feedback must be honest, evidence-based, and comply with UK defamation law. We may remove or edit content that violates policies, is inaccurate, or exposes us to liability. Where required by law, we will preserve evidence and cooperate with law enforcement.
If you host live sessions, webinars, or in-person gatherings through Gigvora tools, you must ensure that appropriate safeguarding, venue, insurance, and health and safety standards are met. You are responsible for moderating chat, Q&A, and community posts associated with your programmes. We provide moderation tools and the ability to assign community managers. Repeated breaches may result in suspension of publishing privileges, removal of offending members, or closure of a community workspace. Serious breaches, including criminal conduct, will be reported to relevant authorities.

## 7. Obligations of Clients and agencies
Clients must publish briefs that are accurate, lawful, non-discriminatory, and reflective of genuine requirements. Budgets, scopes, deliverables, timelines, and decision criteria must be transparent. You must respond to proposals and communications within reasonable timeframes, provide timely approvals, and ensure that internal stakeholders are empowered to make decisions. When engaging Talent you must provide written statements of work covering scope, deliverables, pricing, intellectual property ownership, confidentiality, and payment terms. All engagements must comply with applicable employment, tax, labour leasing, IR35, off-payroll, and procurement regulations in the relevant jurisdiction.
You must not request Talent to circumvent the platform to avoid fees, solicit unpaid labour, or require activities unrelated to the agreed engagement. Clients are responsible for ensuring safe working environments, safeguarding policies for vulnerable groups, and appropriate insurance (including professional indemnity and public liability). If you onboard Talent into internal systems, you must promptly revoke access when engagements conclude. Clients agree to honour accepted offers and pay invoices on time. Where disputes arise, you must cooperate with Gigvora’s dispute resolution process and provide evidence promptly.

## 8. Obligations of Talent and independent professionals
Talent warrants that all information provided in profiles, proposals, and communications is accurate and up to date. You must possess the skills, qualifications, licences, and permissions required to deliver services, and comply with professional standards applicable to your discipline. You agree to complete deliverables with reasonable skill and care, follow agreed milestones, maintain confidentiality, and adhere to any safeguarding or security requirements specified by Clients or regulators. If you subcontract or collaborate with other specialists, you remain responsible for their conduct, deliverables, and compliance with these Terms.
Talent must issue accurate invoices, maintain records for tax and accounting purposes, and ensure that all payments received via Gigvora are declared in accordance with HMRC obligations or equivalent authorities in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for paying your own taxes, National Insurance, pension contributions, and other statutory charges. You must not misrepresent employment status or attempt to register multiple accounts to manipulate reputation systems. If you are based outside the UK, you must confirm that local laws permit you to deliver services to UK Clients and receive cross-border payments. Gigvora may request evidence of right-to-work, business registration, or professional insurance before or during engagements.

## 9. Fees, subscriptions, and billing
Gigvora offers free and paid membership tiers. Subscription pricing, seat allowances, usage caps, and billing cadence are detailed in order forms or in-app pricing tables. All fees are quoted exclusive of VAT unless stated otherwise. We may update pricing by providing at least 45 days’ notice before renewal. Promotional pricing, credits, or discounts are contingent on timely payment and adherence to usage commitments. Overages for exceeding seat counts, storage limits, or usage thresholds will be invoiced at the rates stated in your agreement. Payments are due within 14 days of invoice date unless otherwise specified. Late payments may attract interest at 4% per annum above the Bank of England base rate, calculated daily, and you will bear reasonable debt recovery costs.
We reserve the right to suspend services if invoices remain unpaid for more than 21 days, to downgrade plans, or to withhold access to new features until the account is brought current. Where you provide payment card details you authorise us to charge fees automatically on renewal dates. For annual subscriptions we will provide renewal reminders at least 30 days prior to renewal. You may terminate at the end of the current billing cycle by providing notice in accordance with clause 17. Paid fees are non-refundable except where required by law or as expressly set out in our Refund Policy. Disputed invoices must be notified within 10 days of receipt with supporting evidence; undisputed amounts remain payable on time.

## 10. Escrow, payments, and currency conversion
For project-based engagements, Clients may deposit funds into escrow. Escrow accounts are operated by FCA-regulated partners in segregated client money accounts. Funds remain the property of the Client until released to Talent following milestone approval, time entry validation, or dispute resolution. Gigvora may charge escrow administration fees as stated in your agreement. Clients must not cancel funding without valid reason once Talent has commenced work. If a Client fails to respond within the agreed review period, we may release funds automatically based on evidence submitted by Talent. Talent must provide deliverables or timesheets via the platform to qualify for release.
Currency conversion is performed at prevailing wholesale rates plus a transparent spread. Cross-border payments may be subject to intermediary bank fees, which Gigvora endeavours to disclose in advance. We are not responsible for delays caused by banks or compliance checks. If funds cannot be released due to regulatory restrictions, sanctions, or incomplete verification, we may refund the Client or hold funds until the issue is resolved. Gigvora is not a bank and does not offer interest on escrow balances. We may freeze transactions suspected of fraud, money laundering, terrorism financing, or sanctions breaches, and will report suspicious activity to relevant authorities.

## 11. Intellectual property and licences
Unless otherwise agreed in writing, each party retains ownership of its pre-existing intellectual property. When Talent uploads deliverables, they grant the Client a worldwide, irrevocable, transferable, royalty-free licence to use, reproduce, adapt, and distribute the deliverables solely for the purposes described in the engagement contract once full payment is received. Clients grant Talent a limited licence to use their brand assets, templates, and confidential materials solely to perform the engagement. Both parties grant Gigvora a non-exclusive licence to host, store, process, transmit, and display Content as necessary to provide the services, enforce policies, improve workflows, and comply with law. You warrant that you have obtained all necessary rights, consents, and licences for Content you upload and that it does not infringe third-party rights.
Gigvora owns all intellectual property in the platform, including software, documentation, user interfaces, workflows, brand assets, and proprietary datasets. Nothing in these Terms transfers ownership to you. You must not register or use domains, social media handles, or advertising keywords containing Gigvora trademarks without prior written consent. Feedback, suggestions, or ideas you submit may be used by Gigvora without obligation or attribution. If you believe that Content infringes intellectual property rights, notify legal@gigvora.com with detailed evidence; we may remove or disable access while investigating.

## 12. Data protection and privacy
Gigvora acts as a data controller for personal data collected to operate the platform and as a data processor when handling personal data on behalf of Clients under data processing agreements. We comply with the UK GDPR, Data Protection Act 2018, and applicable international data protection laws. Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share personal data, including categories of data, lawful bases, retention periods, and cross-border transfer safeguards. Clients acting as controllers must ensure that they have a lawful basis to share personal data with Gigvora and Talent, provide appropriate privacy notices, and honour individual rights requests. Talent must handle personal data received via the platform responsibly, using it only for legitimate engagement-related purposes and deleting it when no longer required.
We implement technical and organisational security measures including encryption, access controls, audit trails, vulnerability management, and incident response plans aligned with ISO 27001 principles. You must implement your own security safeguards, including device protection, secure storage of exported data, and segregation of duties. Data breaches impacting personal data must be reported to Gigvora within 24 hours of discovery by emailing security@gigvora.com with available details. We will cooperate to investigate, mitigate harm, and fulfil regulatory reporting obligations. Where cross-border transfers occur, we rely on adequacy regulations, the UK International Data Transfer Agreement, or Standard Contractual Clauses supplemented by risk assessments.

## 13. Confidentiality and records
Each party agrees to keep confidential information received from the other party strictly confidential, using it only for the purposes of the Agreement. Confidential information includes commercial terms, business plans, technical documentation, non-public product roadmaps, user data, and proprietary algorithms. It excludes information already known, independently developed without reference to the disclosing party, or disclosed under legal obligation. Confidential information may be shared with employees, contractors, advisors, or regulators who need to know it, provided they are bound by confidentiality obligations no less protective than those set out here. Both parties will take reasonable measures to secure confidential information against unauthorised access or disclosure.
Unless prohibited by law, each party will promptly notify the other if compelled by court order, regulator, or authority to disclose confidential information, allowing the other party to seek protective measures. At termination, each party must either return or securely destroy confidential information upon request, subject to statutory record-keeping obligations. Gigvora may retain anonymised or aggregated data for analytics and service improvement, provided it cannot reasonably be used to identify individuals or your organisation. Breach of confidentiality obligations may cause irreparable harm, entitling the injured party to injunctive relief in addition to other remedies.

## 14. Third-party services and integrations
The platform integrates with tools such as video conferencing providers, calendar systems, CRMs, payroll processors, applicant tracking systems, identity verification services, and code repositories. Integrations may be provided by third parties under their own terms, privacy notices, and service levels. You are responsible for reviewing and complying with those terms. Gigvora does not guarantee the availability, security, or accuracy of third-party integrations and is not liable for loss arising from their use. We may disable or substitute integrations where required by technical changes, security concerns, or contractual obligations. If you connect custom integrations via our APIs, you must follow published developer guidelines, maintain API keys securely, and not exceed rate limits.
Third-party marketplace listings may include partner services, tooling, or resources. Purchase or use of partner offerings is solely between you and the partner. Gigvora may receive referral fees or commissions for partner introductions; these do not affect the price you pay unless expressly agreed. Partners must meet Gigvora’s due diligence standards, but we do not warrant their performance. Any disputes with partners must be resolved directly with them, though we may assist in good faith to coordinate communication.

## 15. Support, incidents, and service credits
Gigvora provides multi-channel support during UK Business Days, including email, in-platform ticketing, and optional premium support. Response targets are detailed in support plans; failure to meet targets entitles enterprise customers to service credits but does not constitute breach. Critical incidents (Priority 1) are acknowledged within 30 minutes and resolved or mitigated as soon as reasonably practicable. We maintain a status page showing real-time incidents, planned maintenance, and post-incident reviews. You agree to provide sufficient information, diagnostic logs, and contact availability to aid troubleshooting. We may ask you to implement recommended configuration changes to prevent recurrence. Failure to cooperate may limit our ability to provide assistance.
Where an incident is caused by your configuration, third-party services, or misuse, we may charge reasonable professional services fees for remediation. Support does not cover custom development, extensive training, or managed services unless purchased separately. You may nominate up to five authorised contacts for enterprise support plans; requests from other individuals may be redirected through those contacts to maintain security. We reserve the right to decline support where requests are abusive, excessive, or unrelated to the platform.

## 16. Dispute resolution
If a dispute arises between Client and Talent regarding deliverables, quality, timelines, or payments, the parties must first attempt to resolve it amicably through the platform’s messaging and dispute workflow. If unresolved within seven days, either party may escalate to Gigvora’s dispute resolution team by submitting evidence (contracts, briefs, communication history, deliverables, and supporting documentation). We will review evidence impartially, may request additional information, and aim to propose a resolution within 10 Business Days. Possible outcomes include release of escrow funds, partial refunds, milestone adjustments, or referral to mediation. Our decision is based on evidence provided and platform policies; however, it does not prevent parties from seeking legal remedies through the courts.
Where disputes involve suspected misconduct, fraud, or policy breaches, we may temporarily freeze accounts, restrict messaging, or suspend payouts while investigations occur. You agree to cooperate fully, including attending virtual meetings, providing witness statements, and preserving relevant records. Frivolous or bad faith disputes may result in sanctions, including suspension of dispute privileges or account termination. For enterprise customers with bespoke dispute arrangements, terms in the service schedule prevail.

## 17. Term, suspension, and termination
This Agreement commences when you first access the platform and continues until terminated by either party. You may terminate by providing 30 days’ written notice to support@gigvora.com or via in-platform offboarding tools, subject to payment of outstanding fees and completion of active engagements. Gigvora may terminate or suspend access immediately where: (a) you materially breach these Terms and fail to remedy within 14 days of notice; (b) payment remains overdue for more than 21 days; (c) we reasonably suspect fraud, misuse, or illegal activity; (d) maintaining the relationship would cause us to breach law, regulation, or contractual obligations; or (e) insolvency, administration, or liquidation proceedings are commenced against you. On termination you must cease using the platform, pay outstanding invoices, and download required data within 30 days. After that period we may archive or delete data subject to statutory retention requirements.
Termination does not affect rights and obligations accrued before termination, including indemnities, confidentiality, intellectual property, and limitations of liability. If termination occurs mid-subscription due to your breach, fees paid are non-refundable and remaining instalments become immediately due. If Gigvora terminates for convenience (i.e., without cause), we will refund pre-paid fees pro-rata for the unused portion of the subscription.

## 18. Warranties and disclaimers
Each party warrants that it has the right and authority to enter into this Agreement. Gigvora warrants that it will provide the services with reasonable skill and care, using appropriately qualified personnel, and that the platform will materially conform to documentation. Except for express warranties, the services are provided “as is” without implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. We do not guarantee that the platform will be error-free, uninterrupted, or that insights generated by analytics, AI features, or automation will achieve specific outcomes. You acknowledge that hiring decisions, vetting, compliance assessments, and project management remain your responsibility.
To the extent permitted by law, we disclaim liability for decisions made based on information obtained through the platform, third-party services, or community interactions. We do not provide legal, tax, or financial advice; any guidance offered through support interactions, templates, or tooltips is for general information only. You should consult qualified professionals before taking action.

## 19. Liability cap and exclusions
Nothing in this Agreement limits or excludes liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence, fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation, or any liability that cannot be excluded by law. Subject to the foregoing, each party’s total aggregate liability arising from or related to the Agreement (whether in contract, tort, negligence, misrepresentation, restitution, or otherwise) is limited to the greater of (a) the total fees paid or payable by you to Gigvora in the 12 months preceding the event giving rise to the claim, or (b) £25,000. We are not liable for: (i) loss of profits, business, contracts, revenue, or anticipated savings; (ii) loss of goodwill or reputation; (iii) loss or corruption of data that could have been prevented by reasonable backups; (iv) consequential, indirect, incidental, or special damages; or (v) losses arising from third-party services beyond our reasonable control.
You agree to indemnify and hold Gigvora, our officers, directors, employees, contractors, and partners harmless from claims, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising from your breach of these Terms, violation of applicable law, or infringement of third-party rights. We will notify you promptly of any indemnified claim, provide reasonable cooperation, and allow you to control the defence, provided you do not settle in a manner that imposes obligations on Gigvora without consent.

## 20. Changes to the services and terms
We may update these Terms to reflect changes in law, best practice, or service improvements. Material updates will be notified via email, in-app notifications, or administrator dashboards at least 30 days before they take effect. Urgent changes required to address security vulnerabilities, comply with legal requirements, or prevent abuse may take effect immediately, with notification provided as soon as practicable. Your continued use of the platform after the effective date constitutes acceptance. If you do not agree to the changes, you must stop using the services and request account closure. Historical versions are archived within the Trust Centre for reference.
We may also update policies referenced in these Terms, such as Privacy, Refund, Community Guidelines, or Security documentation. Administrators should review updates promptly and cascade relevant changes to their teams. Where product updates require action from you (for example, new data processing clauses or consent mechanisms), you agree to implement those changes within the stated timeframe.

## 21. Force majeure
Neither party is liable for delay or failure to perform obligations (except payment obligations) caused by events beyond reasonable control, including natural disasters, pandemic response measures, war, terrorism, civil unrest, industrial disputes not involving the affected party’s workforce, failure of telecommunications or internet services, power outages, supplier failures, or governmental actions. The affected party must notify the other promptly, take reasonable steps to mitigate the impact, and resume performance as soon as practicable. If force majeure continues for more than 60 consecutive days, either party may terminate the Agreement on 14 days’ written notice without liability, provided outstanding fees for delivered services remain payable.

## 22. Notices and communication
Official notices under this Agreement must be in writing and delivered by email to legal@gigvora.com (for Gigvora) and the primary contact listed in your workspace settings (for you), or by recorded delivery to the registered address. Notices are deemed received: (a) at 9am UK time on the next Business Day after sending by email (if no bounce-back is received); or (b) two Business Days after posting within the UK, or five Business Days internationally. Operational communications, support updates, and policy reminders may be delivered via in-app notifications, chat, SMS, or other channels. You must keep contact information accurate and ensure that emails from @gigvora.com domains bypass spam filters.

## 23. General provisions
This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties regarding the services and supersedes prior proposals, discussions, or understandings. No partnership, joint venture, agency, or employment relationship is created. You may not assign, transfer, or novate this Agreement without our prior written consent; we may assign to an affiliate or successor in connection with a corporate restructuring or asset sale. Failure to exercise a right or remedy does not constitute a waiver. If any provision is held invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in full force and effect, and the parties will negotiate a valid replacement provision that reflects the original intent as closely as possible. Clauses intended to survive termination, including confidentiality, intellectual property, liability, indemnities, and payment obligations, remain enforceable after expiry or termination.

## 24. Contact and feedback
Questions about these Terms should be directed to legal@gigvora.com. We welcome feedback on how to improve clarity, accessibility, and compliance with sector-specific requirements. If you believe a policy, fee, or feature is inconsistent with applicable law, notify us promptly with supporting details. We regularly consult with our Legal Advisory Council, composed of solicitors, compliance specialists, and industry representatives, to ensure our governance framework keeps pace with regulatory expectations.`,
