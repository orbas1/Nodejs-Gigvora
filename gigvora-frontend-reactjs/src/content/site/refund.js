  body: `## 1. Purpose of this policy
This Refund Policy describes how Gigvora Technologies Ltd (“Gigvora”, “we”, “us”) handles refunds, credits, chargebacks, and related billing adjustments for subscriptions, platform services, escrow payments, Experience Launchpad programmes, training, and other purchasable options. It supplements our Terms and Conditions, Privacy Policy, and specific agreements signed with enterprise customers. We drafted this policy to be consistent with the Consumer Rights Act 2015, the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013, the Payment Services Regulations 2017, and industry best practice for digital marketplaces. By purchasing services, funding escrow, or receiving payouts you agree to the terms below.
Our overarching principles are fairness, transparency, and prompt communication. Where possible we offer the choice of refunds to the original payment method or account credits applied to future invoices. Refunds are processed in the original currency where feasible; if conversion is required, wholesale rates plus a modest spread will be used and disclosed. We aim to process approved refunds within 10 Business Days, though bank settlement times may vary.

## 2. Cooling-off rights for consumers
If you are a UK or EU consumer (an individual acting outside trade, business, or profession) purchasing a subscription or paid add-on directly from Gigvora online, you typically have a 14-day statutory cooling-off period starting the day after purchase. You may cancel within that window by emailing billing@gigvora.com or using in-app cancellation tools. We will refund the subscription fee in full unless you requested immediate access or we have already provided the service in full. Where partial use occurred, we may deduct a proportionate amount reflecting the value of services delivered before cancellation. Cooling-off rights do not apply to bespoke professional services executed during the cancellation period with your agreement, to digital content once streaming or download has begun, or to Experience Launchpad cohorts once the first live session has taken place (unless agreed otherwise).
Business customers, agencies, and public sector bodies do not benefit from statutory cooling-off rights, but Gigvora may offer discretionary goodwill refunds where no substantial value has been derived. All cooling-off requests must include purchase reference, account email, and confirmation that any associated materials have been deleted or returned.

## 3. Subscription plans and seat licences
Monthly subscriptions can be cancelled at any time and remain active until the end of the current billing cycle. We do not issue partial refunds for unused days on monthly plans. Annual subscriptions renew automatically unless cancelled at least 30 days before renewal. If you cancel an annual plan within 30 days of the initial purchase, we will refund unused months minus any promotional discounts consumed. After 30 days, refunds are not typically provided; however, we may offer prorated credits in exceptional circumstances such as regulatory changes that significantly impact the service or confirmed service failures lasting more than seven consecutive days. Credits can be applied to future invoices within 12 months. Seat reductions on annual plans take effect at the next renewal.
If your account is downgraded due to non-payment or policy breaches, fees already paid are non-refundable. To avoid unexpected charges, administrators should review renewal reminders, available seats, and usage thresholds displayed in the billing dashboard.

## 4. Pay-as-you-go services and professional support
Where you purchase one-off services such as premium support blocks, mentoring, compliance reviews, or custom implementation, fees are payable upfront. You may cancel up to five Business Days before the scheduled session for a full refund. Cancellations within five Business Days incur a 50% fee; within 24 hours no refund is provided because resources have been committed. If we need to reschedule for operational reasons, we will offer alternative dates or a full refund. Where a professional session fails to take place due to Gigvora’s fault, we will provide either a rebooking at no additional cost or a refund.
If deliverables do not meet agreed specifications, please notify us within seven days of delivery with detailed feedback. We will attempt to rectify issues promptly. If we are unable to remedy within a reasonable timeframe, you may request a partial or full refund proportionate to the unmet deliverables. Refund decisions take into account the scope delivered, effort invested, and feasibility of rework.

## 5. Experience Launchpad programmes and events
Deposits for Experience Launchpad cohorts secure your place and cover onboarding resources. Deposits become non-refundable once we provide access to course materials or commence orientation sessions unless cancellation is due to Gigvora postponing or cancelling the programme. Tuition fees (beyond the deposit) are refundable on a sliding scale: 100% if cancellation is received at least 21 days before the first live session, 50% between 7 and 20 days, and 0% within 7 days unless you present exceptional circumstances (such as medical emergencies) with supporting evidence. If Gigvora cancels a cohort before it begins, all participants receive a full refund or the option to transfer to a future cohort. If we cancel mid-cohort for reasons within our control, we will provide a prorated refund for missed modules.
For in-person events, workshops, or volunteering projects, third-party venue or equipment costs may be deducted from refunds if non-refundable charges were incurred on your behalf. We always provide receipts and work to minimise such deductions.

## 6. Escrow deposits and milestone releases
Escrow protects both Clients and Talent. Funds deposited into escrow remain the Client’s property until milestones are approved. The following refund rules apply:
- If Talent withdraws or fails to deliver agreed work, and the Client provides evidence, we will refund remaining escrow balance to the Client minus any applicable payment processing fees.
- If the Client cancels after work has begun without valid cause, we may release funds to Talent based on work completed. Disputes are handled through clause 9.
- If a milestone is disputed, funds remain in escrow until resolution. We may split funds between parties according to evidence, or refund to the Client if Talent cannot substantiate delivery.
- Escrow fees are non-refundable once funds are deposited because payment providers charge per transaction. However, if Gigvora cancels an engagement before work commences, we will absorb those fees.
Clients must raise refund requests within 30 days of the relevant milestone due date. After funds are released to Talent, refunds are no longer possible via Gigvora; parties must resolve directly unless fraud or policy breaches occurred. If a project becomes impossible due to force majeure (e.g., natural disaster, regulatory prohibition), we will refund unearned escrow funds to the Client, less unavoidable processing costs.

## 7. Chargebacks and disputes with payment providers
Initiating a chargeback with your bank or card issuer triggers additional investigation costs. We encourage you to contact billing@gigvora.com before raising a chargeback; in many cases we can resolve issues faster through our dispute process. If a chargeback is filed, we may suspend account access while we investigate. Where the chargeback is found to be unwarranted, we reserve the right to reinstate the charge, add a £25 administrative fee, and require future payments via bank transfer. Repeated abusive chargebacks may result in account termination. If the chargeback is legitimate because of unauthorised card use, please provide supporting documentation so we can secure the account and prevent recurrence.

## 8. Refunds to Talent
Talent may occasionally need to refund Clients for overpayments, duplicate invoices, or disputed deliverables. We facilitate refunds by debiting the Talent’s escrow or wallet balance. If sufficient funds are unavailable, we may offset future payouts or require repayment via bank transfer. Failure to repay may result in account suspension or debt collection. Talent should review invoices carefully before submission and maintain clear records of deliverables, communications, and approvals to avoid disputes. Where Gigvora determines that Talent engaged in misconduct (fraud, plagiarism, policy breach), we may refund Clients in full and recover amounts from Talent as described in the Terms and Conditions.

## 9. Dispute resolution process
If a Client and Talent disagree about work quality, timeliness, or scope, they should first attempt to resolve the issue through the platform’s messaging tools. If unresolved within seven days, either party can escalate to Gigvora by submitting a dispute ticket with supporting evidence. Our dispute specialists review submissions, may request additional information, and aim to provide a decision within 10 Business Days. Possible outcomes include full refund to the Client, partial refund, release of funds to Talent, or splitting funds proportionally. Decisions are based on evidence, platform policies, and fairness. Either party may pursue external legal remedies if dissatisfied. Disputes raised more than 30 days after milestone due date may be declined unless exceptional circumstances exist.
Gigvora may decline disputes that lack evidence, are frivolous, or concern matters outside our control (e.g., offline arrangements not documented on the platform). We encourage clear statements of work, milestone definitions, and timely communication to minimise disputes.

## 10. Promotional credits and referral incentives
Occasionally we issue promotional credits, referral bonuses, or goodwill credits. These have no cash value, cannot be exchanged for currency, and may expire if unused by the stated date. If a credit was granted contingent on maintaining an active subscription or completing a milestone and you subsequently cancel or fail to meet conditions, credits may be revoked or the discount clawed back. Where refunds are issued for purchases made using credits, only the cash portion is refunded. We may suspend credit programmes to prevent abuse or comply with regulation. Any suspected fraudulent activity will result in removal of credits and potential account action.

## 11. Taxes and withholding
Refund amounts exclude any taxes already remitted to authorities. Where legally possible we will adjust tax filings to reflect refunded transactions; otherwise tax elements may not be recoverable. International Clients and Talent are responsible for local tax compliance. If withholding tax applies and you have not provided valid tax documentation, refunds may be reduced by the amount Gigvora is required to remit to tax authorities. Provide updated tax certificates promptly to avoid unnecessary deductions.

## 12. Payment methods and processing times
Refunds are issued to the original payment method wherever possible. Card refunds may take 5–10 Business Days to appear on statements. Bank transfer refunds generally settle within 3–5 Business Days for UK accounts and 5–12 Business Days for international accounts. For security reasons we cannot send refunds to alternative payees or payment instruments without performing enhanced verification. If the original payment method is closed or no longer available, we may issue a manual bank transfer after verifying ownership. We cannot refund in cash, cryptocurrency, or to prepaid gift cards.

## 13. Currency conversion
Where purchases were made in a currency different from the account’s billing currency, refunds are calculated using the original exchange rate applied at the time of purchase. This prevents gains or losses resulting from currency fluctuations. If the original provider cannot process refunds in the source currency, we will convert using an interbank rate at the time of refund plus a transparent spread not exceeding 1.2%. We provide statements showing rate applied and resulting amount.

## 14. Compliance with sanctions and AML requirements
We comply with UK, EU, US, and UN sanctions regimes as well as anti-money laundering regulations. If a refund would breach sanctions—for example, by returning funds to a sanctioned entity—we will freeze the funds and liaise with authorities for instructions. You must provide requested information to support compliance checks; failure to do so may delay or prevent refunds. We report suspicious activity to the National Crime Agency and other relevant bodies. Where law enforcement instructs us to retain funds, we will comply even if you request a refund.

## 15. Platform downtime and service credits
In the unlikely event of prolonged platform downtime attributable to Gigvora, enterprise customers may be eligible for service credits as set out in their service level agreements. Credits are applied to future invoices and are not redeemable for cash. To claim a credit, submit a request within 30 days of the incident including evidence of downtime and impact. Credits are calculated as a percentage of monthly subscription fees for the affected service. Service credits may be combined with other remedies only at Gigvora’s discretion.

## 16. Mistaken or duplicate payments
If you accidentally make duplicate payments, notify billing@gigvora.com within 30 days. Provide transaction IDs or bank references to help us locate the payments. Once verified we will refund duplicates promptly. If duplicate funds have already been allocated to escrow and released to Talent, we will coordinate with the recipient to recover funds. Gigvora may offset duplicates against outstanding invoices where appropriate.

## 17. Enterprise contracts and negotiated terms
Enterprise agreements may contain bespoke refund provisions, such as extended notice periods, minimum commitment buy-outs, or dedicated credit pools. Where a signed contract conflicts with this policy, the contract prevails. Enterprise customers should refer to their master services agreement, statements of work, or addenda for detailed terms. We encourage enterprise administrators to schedule periodic reviews with our account management team to ensure arrangements remain suitable.

## 18. Non-payment and collections
If invoices remain unpaid beyond agreed terms, we may suspend services and initiate debt recovery. Once a debt is referred to a collection agency or legal counsel, additional recovery costs may be added. Payments received after suspension are first applied to outstanding balances, with any remaining amount used for future services. Refund requests will not be processed until overdue balances are cleared. We may report serious delinquencies to credit reference agencies in line with applicable laws.

## 19. How to request a refund
To request a refund, email billing@gigvora.com or open a billing ticket in the platform. Include account ID, transaction reference, amount, reason for request, and supporting evidence (such as milestone approvals, cancellation emails, or bank statements). We acknowledge requests within two Business Days and provide a decision within 10 Business Days unless complex investigation is required. If additional documentation is needed, please respond within seven days to avoid delays. You may escalate unresolved concerns to financelead@gigvora.com or, for payment service issues, to our FCA-regulated partners. Consumers may also seek advice from Citizens Advice or the Financial Ombudsman Service where applicable.

## 20. Changes to this policy
We may update this policy to reflect legal changes, improvements to our services, or feedback from our community. Material changes will be communicated via email and in-app notifications at least 30 days before taking effect. Continued use of the platform after the effective date constitutes acceptance. Historic versions are archived and available on request.
