  body: `## 1. Who we are and how to contact us
Gigvora Technologies Ltd (“Gigvora”, “we”, “us”) is registered in England and Wales under company number 13749204. Our registered office is 38 Chancery Lane, London WC2A 1EN. We operate a digital platform that enables companies, agencies, and independent professionals to collaborate on projects, gigs, volunteering opportunities, mentoring, and Experience Launchpad programmes. For the purposes of the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR), we act as a data controller when we determine the purposes and means of processing personal data, and as a data processor when we handle personal data strictly on behalf of enterprise customers under a data processing agreement. Questions about this policy should be directed to our Data Protection Officer (DPO) at privacy@gigvora.com or by writing to the registered office. If you are based in the European Economic Area you can contact our EU representative via euprivacy@gigvora.com.
We are registered with the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) under registration number ZB452198. You have the right to lodge a complaint with the ICO or your local supervisory authority at any time, though we encourage you to contact us first so that we can address your concerns. We update this policy periodically; the “last updated” date reflects the most recent revision. Historic versions can be requested from privacy@gigvora.com.

## 2. Personal data we collect
We collect and process the following categories of personal data:
- **Identification data:** name, preferred name, title, date of birth (where required for verification), nationality, gender (optional), and unique IDs.
- **Contact data:** email address, phone number, postal address, emergency contact (for volunteering events), and workplace location.
- **Profile data:** professional headline, biography, skills, industry focus, pronouns, hourly rates, portfolio links, badges, community memberships, language preferences, and availability.
- **Transactional data:** proposals, milestones, invoices, time logs, expense claims, subscription purchases, and payment history.
- **Verification data:** identity documents, proof of address, right-to-work evidence, background check results, insurance certificates, and professional licences.
- **Usage data:** logins, device information, browser type, operating system, IP address, session duration, feature usage, referral sources, security events, and support interactions.
- **Communications data:** messages, emails, video calls, meeting recordings (when consented), community posts, feedback, and dispute evidence.
- **Marketing data:** newsletter preferences, campaign engagement, survey responses, webinar attendance, and event registrations.
We may collect special category data such as health or accessibility requirements when necessary to facilitate in-person volunteering, events, or workplace adjustments, but only with your explicit consent or where required by law. We avoid collecting data relating to criminal convictions unless necessary for safeguarding roles and permitted by law.

## 3. How we obtain personal data
Personal data is obtained directly from you when you register, update your profile, submit documents, engage with support, or participate in programmes. We also receive data from:
- Employers, agencies, or universities that enrol you into workspaces or submit references.
- Identity verification partners, sanctions screening providers, or credit reference agencies who confirm eligibility and manage risk.
- Payment processors and banking partners who facilitate escrow, payouts, and reconciliation.
- Publicly available sources such as Companies House, LinkedIn, and professional directories where we verify credentials or augment company records.
- Event partners supplying attendance lists for sessions hosted on Gigvora infrastructure.
Where we obtain data from third parties, we confirm that the disclosure is lawful and that appropriate notices have been provided. We combine datasets to maintain accurate, up-to-date records and reduce the need for repeated data entry.

## 4. Purposes and lawful bases for processing
We rely on the following lawful bases under UK GDPR:
- **Contractual necessity:** To create and administer accounts, match talent to briefs, enable messaging, manage projects, process payments, provide support, enforce platform rules, and deliver agreed services.
- **Legitimate interests:** To improve user experience, safeguard the community, prevent fraud, maintain platform security, analyse aggregated usage trends, develop new features, and promote relevant opportunities. We balance these interests against your rights and implement safeguards such as pseudonymisation and opt-out mechanisms.
- **Legal obligation:** To comply with anti-money laundering laws, financial reporting duties, tax requirements, employment regulations, health and safety obligations, and requests from competent authorities.
- **Consent:** For optional marketing communications, cookies beyond strictly necessary categories, participation in case studies, publication of testimonials, recording of webinars, and processing special category data where required for accessibility or safeguarding.
- **Vital interests:** In rare cases to protect life or prevent serious harm during events or volunteering projects.
If we rely on consent you may withdraw it at any time via account settings, unsubscribe links, or by contacting privacy@gigvora.com. Withdrawal does not affect prior lawful processing.

## 5. Automated decision-making and profiling
We use algorithms and machine learning to recommend projects, rank proposals, flag potential risk, and surface marketplace insights. Automated tools evaluate factors such as skills, experience, location, availability, rate benchmarks, quality scores, and historical collaboration success. We do not make solely automated decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects without human oversight. Where automated scoring influences opportunity matching, human reviewers regularly audit outputs and you may request manual review or challenge a decision by contacting support or privacy@gigvora.com. We maintain detailed documentation of models, training data, and fairness testing, and monitor for bias. You may opt out of personalised recommendations in privacy settings, though doing so may reduce relevance of matches.

## 6. Sharing personal data
We share personal data with:
- Other members within your workspace to facilitate collaboration, subject to role-based access controls.
- Enterprise customers who invite you to programmes, subject to their controller responsibilities.
- Payment providers (Stripe, Currencycloud, Modulr), banking partners, and accounting platforms to process payments, tax forms, and financial reporting.
- Identity verification partners (Onfido, ComplyAdvantage) for KYC, AML, sanctions, and fraud prevention checks.
- Cloud hosting providers (AWS EU-West, Cloudflare), analytics partners (Mixpanel, Metabase), customer support tools (Intercom, Chatwoot), and communication platforms (Twilio, Zoom) who process data under written contracts.
- Professional advisers (lawyers, auditors, insurers) and regulators where necessary to protect rights or comply with law.
- Prospective purchasers or investors in the context of corporate transactions, subject to confidentiality.
We require third parties to implement adequate security, confidentiality, and data protection safeguards. We do not sell personal data. When partners act as independent controllers they will provide their own privacy notices.

## 7. International transfers
Personal data is primarily stored in the United Kingdom and European Union. Where data is transferred outside the UK or EEA, we rely on UK adequacy regulations, Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), the UK International Data Transfer Agreement (IDTA), or other approved safeguards. We conduct transfer impact assessments to evaluate recipient laws and implement supplementary measures such as encryption, access restrictions, and policy commitments. Copies of relevant transfer agreements can be requested by emailing privacy@gigvora.com, subject to redactions for confidentiality.

## 8. Data retention
We retain personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this policy, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. Typical retention periods are:
- Account data: retained while the account is active and for six years after closure to comply with limitation periods and record-keeping obligations.
- Financial records, invoices, and tax documentation: retained for seven years.
- Identity verification records: retained for five years after the relationship ends to meet anti-money laundering requirements.
- Support tickets and dispute records: retained for six years.
- Marketing preferences: retained until you opt out or the list is refreshed.
We may anonymise data for analytics and service improvement. Anonymised information cannot reasonably be re-associated with individuals and may be kept indefinitely.

## 9. Security measures
We implement organisational, technical, and physical controls including encryption at rest and in transit, zero trust network architecture, role-based access, MFA for administrators, continuous security monitoring, vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, secure coding practices, incident response playbooks, and supplier due diligence. Staff undergo background screening where permitted by law and regular security and privacy training. Access to personal data is limited to personnel who need it for their role. We maintain business continuity and disaster recovery plans tested at least annually. Despite robust controls, no system is entirely immune to risk. If a data breach is likely to result in a risk to individuals, we will notify affected users and regulators without undue delay in accordance with UK GDPR.
You are responsible for maintaining the security of your devices, browsers, and passwords, enabling multi-factor authentication, and notifying us promptly if you suspect unauthorised access or phishing attempts. Administrators must manage user lifecycle events, ensuring that former employees or contractors lose access promptly.

## 10. Marketing communications
We send service notifications that are necessary for account management, including transactional emails, security alerts, policy updates, and mandatory notices. These communications form part of the service and cannot usually be opted out. Marketing emails, research invitations, and event announcements are sent only where we have your consent or rely on the soft opt-in for existing customers under the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR). You can manage marketing preferences in account settings or by using the unsubscribe link in emails. We maintain suppression lists to ensure opt-out requests are honoured. We do not use personal data for third-party direct marketing.

## 11. Cookies and similar technologies
Our website and applications use cookies, device identifiers, and similar technologies to provide essential functionality, remember preferences, prevent fraud, and analyse usage. Strictly necessary cookies are required for login, security, and load balancing. Analytics cookies help us understand how the platform is used so we can improve navigation and accessibility. Marketing cookies, deployed only with consent, support campaigns and performance measurement. Detailed information is provided in our Cookie Policy, including retention periods, third-party vendors, and instructions on how to manage or revoke consent. You can change cookie preferences at any time through the Trust Centre or browser settings. Disabling certain cookies may affect functionality.

## 12. Children and vulnerable users
The platform is not intended for children under 18. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children without parental or guardian consent. If we become aware that a child has provided personal data without appropriate consent we will delete it and close the account unless continued processing is required to protect the child’s welfare. For volunteering programmes involving vulnerable groups we conduct enhanced safeguarding assessments and require participating organisations to provide appropriate supervision, training, and risk assessments.

## 13. Your rights
Under UK GDPR and applicable data protection laws you have the following rights:
- **Right of access:** Request a copy of personal data we hold about you along with supplementary information.
- **Right to rectification:** Request correction of inaccurate or incomplete data.
- **Right to erasure:** Request deletion of data where processing is no longer necessary, consent is withdrawn, or the data was processed unlawfully. We may retain data where required by law.
- **Right to restrict processing:** Request temporary suspension of processing while accuracy or objections are investigated.
- **Right to data portability:** Receive personal data you provided in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format and transmit it to another controller.
- **Right to object:** Object to processing based on legitimate interests or direct marketing.
- **Rights related to automated decision-making:** Request human intervention, express your point of view, and challenge automated decisions that have legal or significant effects.
You can exercise rights by emailing privacy@gigvora.com or using in-app tools. We respond within one month, extendable by two months for complex requests. We may need to verify identity before fulfilling requests. There is no charge for exercising rights unless requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in which case we may charge a reasonable fee or refuse the request.

## 14. Controllers, processors, and customer data
When enterprise customers invite you into a workspace they act as independent controllers of the data they collect and process. They are responsible for providing their own privacy notices, ensuring lawful basis, and responding to rights requests relating to their activities. We act as a processor for such customer data and process it strictly according to documented instructions. Our Data Processing Agreement (DPA) forms part of enterprise contracts and sets out each party’s responsibilities, including confidentiality, sub-processor approvals, security measures, and audit rights. We maintain a list of authorised sub-processors in the Trust Centre and provide 30 days’ notice before adding or substituting sub-processors. Customers may object to changes on reasonable grounds; if unresolved we may terminate the affected services.

## 15. Transparency reporting and law enforcement
We may receive lawful requests for data from regulators, courts, or law enforcement agencies. We scrutinise each request, ensuring it is valid, proportionate, and limited to the data necessary. Where permitted, we notify affected users before disclosing data so they can seek legal remedies. We maintain transparency reports summarising the volume and type of requests. If we believe a request is overly broad or lacks authority, we challenge it. We also cooperate with tax authorities, labour regulators, or other bodies where required to uphold legal obligations or protect individuals from harm.

## 16. International members
If you access the platform from outside the UK, you acknowledge that personal data may be transferred to and processed in the UK, EU, or other jurisdictions with different data protection laws. We apply the safeguards described in section 7 to protect your data regardless of location. Local mandatory laws may grant you additional rights; we honour those rights to the extent required. For California residents we comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and provide disclosures on categories of personal information collected, purposes, and rights to access or delete. For Australian residents we comply with the Australian Privacy Principles. Specific regional addenda are available in the Trust Centre.

## 17. Links to third-party websites
The platform and communications may include links to third-party websites or services. Clicking those links may allow third parties to collect or share data about you. We do not control these third-party websites and are not responsible for their privacy statements or practices. We encourage you to read the privacy notice of every website you visit. Linking does not imply endorsement; use is at your own risk.

## 18. Changes to this policy
We may revise this policy to reflect regulatory changes, new services, or feedback from our community. If changes are material we will notify you via email or prominent in-app notice at least 30 days before they take effect. Continued use of the services after the effective date indicates acceptance. For minor updates (such as clarifications) we may update the policy without formal notice, but the new version will always be dated and accessible. Historical versions can be requested for audit purposes. Where a change materially alters how we process personal data for which we previously relied on consent, we will seek fresh consent or provide an opt-out mechanism.

## 19. Contact and complaints
For privacy enquiries, data subject requests, or complaints, contact privacy@gigvora.com. Please provide sufficient detail to help us respond efficiently. If you are dissatisfied with our response, you may escalate to the ICO at ico.org.uk or to your local data protection authority. We are committed to resolving issues promptly and improving practices through regular audits, staff training, and collaboration with privacy professionals.

## 20. Governance, audits, and accountability
We operate a privacy governance framework overseen by our DPO and Privacy Steering Group. The framework includes quarterly reviews of data protection risks, Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) for new products or high-risk processing, Records of Processing Activities (ROPAs), supplier risk assessments, and mandatory training for all staff and contractors. New joiners complete privacy and security induction within seven days of starting, and refresher training is delivered annually or when major regulatory changes occur. Specialist teams receive tailored modules covering marketing compliance, international transfers, subject access request handling, and incident response. Completion rates are tracked and reported to leadership.
We commission independent audits of our security and privacy controls, including SOC 2 Type II readiness assessments, penetration testing by CREST-accredited providers, and reviews of access controls. Audit findings are prioritised and remedial actions tracked to completion. We engage with legal counsel to monitor regulatory developments, including the ICO’s guidance, EDPB recommendations, and legislation in territories where we operate. Material privacy risks are reported to the board along with mitigation plans.
When new or significantly changed processing is proposed, product teams must complete a privacy impact checklist covering purpose, lawful basis, data minimisation, retention, sharing, security, and user transparency. DPIAs are escalated to the DPO for review. We consult with affected stakeholders, including enterprise customers and community representatives, to ensure changes align with expectations. Where residual risk remains high after mitigation, we consult the ICO before proceeding.
Gigvora maintains a documented incident response plan with defined severity levels, roles, and communication templates. We test the plan through tabletop exercises at least twice per year, involving cross-functional teams including engineering, support, legal, and communications. Lessons learned feed into improved controls and training. We also publish privacy metrics—such as rights request volumes, completion times, and DPIA counts—in our annual Trust Report to demonstrate accountability.
To embed privacy by design, we maintain a network of “privacy champions” across product, engineering, marketing, people, and customer success teams. Champions meet monthly to review upcoming launches, share best practice, and escalate issues to the DPO. They track mitigations in our governance portal, ensuring ownership and deadlines are clear. We also run quarterly awareness campaigns for the wider community covering topics such as phishing, secure document sharing, respectful data use, and regulatory updates. Feedback from these sessions informs future training and tooling investments.
