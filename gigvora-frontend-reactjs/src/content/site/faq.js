  body: `## 1. What is Gigvora and who is it for?
Gigvora is a UK-headquartered platform that unites companies, agencies, independent professionals, mentors, and volunteers. We help teams launch projects, gigs, and programmes faster by combining discovery, vetting, contracting, compliance automation, payments, analytics, and wellbeing resources. Companies use Gigvora to source specialist talent, build hybrid squads, or run large-scale community programmes. Independents manage pipelines, contracts, and invoicing in one place while accessing Launchpad cohorts, mentoring, and community groups. Universities, charities, and public bodies rely on Gigvora for volunteering and skills initiatives with robust safeguarding tooling.

## 2. How do I create an account?
Individuals can create an account by selecting “Join Gigvora” on the homepage, choosing the relevant membership type, and completing identity verification. Organisations can register via the enterprise onboarding form, which requests legal entity details, primary contacts, VAT or tax numbers, and proof of authority. After submission, our compliance team reviews the application within two UK business days. Approved organisations receive an administrator workspace to invite teammates, configure approval chains, and connect their systems. If you are invited by an existing client, accept the email invitation and follow the guided onboarding flow.

## 3. What verification steps are required?
Every member must meet baseline trust requirements. Individuals verify their identity using government-issued documents and biometric checks provided by our FCA-regulated partner. Organisations provide incorporation documents, beneficial ownership declarations, and (where applicable) proof of regulated status. Agencies and consultancies must evidence insurance coverage and worker classification policies. Additional checks—such as DBS, right-to-work, or industry certifications—may be required depending on the project.

## 4. How are projects, gigs, and missions created?
Administrators and authorised managers can publish opportunities from the Creation Studio. The guided builder prompts you to outline scope, deliverables, target skills, budget ranges, timeline, compliance requirements, and preferred collaboration model. You can attach supporting documents, configure milestones, and choose whether to invite specific partners or publish to curated talent pools. Drafts autosave, and compliance scoring highlights missing information or potential risks.

## 5. How does matching and selection work?
Gigvora uses a blend of profile signals, verified experience, availability, and behavioural insights to recommend suitable collaborators. Clients can shortlist candidates, schedule interviews, and share evaluation rubrics within the workspace. Talent receives contextual nudges to tailor proposals and can collaborate with teammates before submitting final responses. You can also bring your own talent pools and manage them privately.

## 6. How are contracts and payments handled?
When a match is confirmed, Gigvora automatically generates compliant contracts based on templates tailored to engagement type and jurisdiction. Clients can add bespoke clauses or upload pre-approved agreements. Payments flow through segregated client money accounts held by our FCA-regulated partners. Funds are released according to milestones or timesheets approved inside the platform. Talent can withdraw to local bank accounts in over 150 countries, with fees displayed upfront. Gigvora issues consolidated invoices, expense reports, and audit trails for finance teams.

## 7. What support is available if something goes wrong?
Our support team operates 24/5 via in-product chat, email, and emergency phone escalation. Response times are published in the Trust Centre and monitored by service-level agreements. If a dispute arises, use the “Raise concern” button on the relevant project. Gigvora mediates within one UK business day, gathers evidence, and proposes resolutions ranging from milestone adjustments to refunds or replacements. Safety or safeguarding issues are prioritised immediately by the trust desk, which can suspend accounts, freeze payments, and coordinate with authorities where required.

## 8. How does Gigvora protect data and privacy?
We comply with UK GDPR, the Data Protection Act 2018, and applicable international transfer rules. Data is encrypted in transit and at rest, with role-based access controls and comprehensive audit logging. Single sign-on, multi-factor authentication, and hardware key enforcement are available for enterprise tenants. We conduct regular penetration tests, operate a responsible disclosure programme, and provide data processing agreements plus sub-processor listings in the Trust Centre.

## 9. Can I integrate Gigvora with existing tools?
Yes. We support integrations with popular ATS, HRIS, CRM, procurement, and finance platforms via secure APIs and native connectors. Administrators can configure integrations from the workspace settings panel, set granular permissions, and map data fields. For bespoke requirements, our developer relations team provides sandbox access, webhook documentation, and solution design workshops. We also offer flat-file exports and BI-ready datasets for analytics teams.

## 10. How do community programmes and Launchpad cohorts operate?
Community organisers can create themed groups, schedule events, and curate resource libraries. Moderation tools include automated flagging, member reporting, and escalation workflows. Launchpad cohorts run as blended learning experiences with live workshops, asynchronous assignments, mentor office hours, and project simulations sourced from partner organisations. Programme owners can track attendance, learning progress, and employment outcomes through analytics dashboards.

## 11. What accessibility and inclusion commitments exist?
Gigvora provides WCAG 2.1 AA-aligned interfaces, keyboard navigation, captions on live sessions, and alternative text requirements for uploads. We offer quiet channels, wellbeing check-ins, and hardship support funds. Members can request reasonable adjustments—such as extended deadlines, interpreters, or assistive technology loans—by contacting access@gigvora.com. We monitor representation metrics and collaborate with DEI partners to reduce bias in matching algorithms.

## 12. How do I close my account or export data?
You can request closure from account settings or by emailing support@gigvora.com. We confirm identity, settle outstanding invoices, and provide data exports (projects, invoices, chats) within 30 days. Personal data that must be retained for legal reasons is stored securely and deleted once obligations expire. Departing members are invited to share feedback via an exit survey so we can keep improving the experience.

## 13. Where can I find further help?
Explore the Support Centre for step-by-step guides, attend weekly onboarding webinars, or join community office hours hosted by customer success. If your question involves a legal or compliance topic, refer to the Terms, Privacy Policy, Refund Policy, and Community Guidelines linked from the Trust Centre. Urgent safeguarding or security issues should be escalated directly to safety@gigvora.com or security@gigvora.com.`,
